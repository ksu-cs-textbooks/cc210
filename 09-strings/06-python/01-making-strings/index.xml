    <description>String variables in Python can be created just like any other variable type weâ€™ve seen so far. To initialize a string variable, we can use the following syntax:&#xA;s = &#34;This is a string!&#34;The text itself should be placed in double quotation marks as seen in this example. This allows the Python interpreter determine what part of the source code file should be treated as text instead of code.&#xA;Special Characters Python supports several special characters that can use in our strings to represent specific symbols.</description>
