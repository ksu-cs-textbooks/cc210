    <title>Parsing Strings :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/09-strings/03-parsing/</link>
    <description>One of the most common things our programs will do with strings is use them to collect data from the user. When we do, we’ll need to parse the data in the string into a format our computer can recognize.&#xA;Parsing typically involves two steps: tokenization and conversion.&#xA;Tokenizing Strings The first step in parsing a string is to tokenize the string, or separate it into its individual elements. For example, let’s say we want our user to be able to input two numbers, representing the coordinates of a square in Tic-Tac-Toe.</description>
