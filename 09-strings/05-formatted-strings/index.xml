    <title>Formatted Strings :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/09-strings/05-formatted-strings/</link>
    <description>We’ve already seen one way that we can create strings of output for our users. In nearly all of the programs we’ve written so far, we have simply placed variables into our print statements, along with strings inside of quotation marks, and then combined them together. However, most programming languages support a way to create formatted output strings.&#xA;The syntax varies for each programming language, but in essence, we can create a string with placeholders for variables, and we can also include information about how those variables should be formatted.</description>
