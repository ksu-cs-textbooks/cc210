      <description>Up to this point, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to store data in many different forms in our programs. We&amp;rsquo;ve used integers and floating point numbers to store various numerical values, and Booleans to store true and false in our programs. We have learned how to make arrays of those data types when we need to store several of them together. We can even create multidimensional arrays when we want to store data in a structured way, such as a grid for representing 2D data in a game.</description>

Using ASCII, we can now store and manipulate text in our programs. There are a couple of different ways our programs store and interact with text, so let&amp;rsquo;s cover both of them here before moving on.
Characters In programming, the smallest piece of text is referred to as a character. We sometimes use the term letter to refer to the smallest parts of text, since a word in text is made up of many letters, but technically symbols such as &amp;amp;, ( and # are not letters, so we should refer to them as characters instead.</description>

      <title>Parsing Strings</title>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/09-strings/03-parsing/index.html</guid>
      <description>One of the most common things our programs will do with strings is use them to collect data from the user. When we do, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to parse the data in the string into a format our computer can recognize.
Parsing typically involves two steps: tokenization and conversion.
Tokenizing Strings The first step in parsing a string is to tokenize the string, or separate it into its individual elements. For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say we want our user to be able to input two numbers, representing the coordinates of a square in Tic-Tac-Toe.</description>

      <description>We can also perform many different operations on strings in our programs. These operations allow us to search within strings, edit them, compare them, and more.
Length First, we can get the length of any string stored in our programs. From the example earlier:
This string has length 11, because it contains 11 characters. We must make sure we count the space as a character, as well as any punctuation or other symbols.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve already seen one way that we can create strings of output for our users. In nearly all of the programs we&amp;rsquo;ve written so far, we have simply placed variables into our print statements, along with strings inside of quotation marks, and then combined them together. However, most programming languages support a way to create formatted output strings.
The syntax varies for each programming language, but in essence, we can create a string with placeholders for variables, and we can also include information about how those variables should be formatted.</description>

      <description>Strings are one of the most useful data types in many computer programs. They allow us to work with real text in our programs, and our users can provide more flexible forms of input that we can parse using string operations in our code.
For the rest of this course, we&amp;rsquo;ll be using increasingly complex forms of input and output, so knowing how to handle parsing and converting those inputs into the data types we need is a very important skill to practice.</description>
