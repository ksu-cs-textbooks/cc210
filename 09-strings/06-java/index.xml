      <description>String variables in Java can be created just like any other variable type we’ve seen so far. To declare a string variable, we can use the following syntax:&#xA;String s;Notice that the keyword String in Java is capitalized. This is because we are actually referring to a class named String that is a part of the Java programming language and not a simple data type. This tends to cause new programmers quite a bit of problems, so it is important to remember that this particular data type is capitalized in Java.</description>

      <description>In many programs, we’ll be reading input from the user into a string variable, and then parsing that input into the various data types we need. Parsing is a two-step process: tokenization and conversion.&#xA;Let’s explore parsing by starting with a program that reads a line from the keyboard.&#xA;// Load required classes public class Example{ public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{ // Scanner variable Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Video Materials&#xA;The string data type includes many built-in operations that we can use to compare, manipulate, and search within strings. We’ll cover several of them on this page, and we’ll also include links at the bottom to additional resources where all of them are listed.&#xA;Length First and foremost is the length() method. It allows us to find the number of characters in a string.&#xA;String s = &#34;This&#34;; System.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Video Materials&#xA;There are also a couple of different approaches we can take to formatting output strings in Java. Let’s take a minute to review both of those and see how they work.&#xA;Concatenation We’ve already seen this approach in several programs in this course. In effect, we can simply build an output string by concatenating strings and the variables we’d like to include in those strings.</description>

      <description>Now that we’ve explored all of the different ways we can use strings in our programs, let’s walk through a worked example to see how we would go about building a useful program that uses everything we’ve learned so far.&#xA;Problem Statement Consider the following problem statement:&#xA;Write a program that will calculate weighted grades for students in a college course. This program should only have a main method.</description>
