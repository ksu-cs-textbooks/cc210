    <title>Summary :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/09-strings/07-summary/</link>
    <description>Strings are one of the most useful data types in many computer programs. They allow us to work with real text in our programs, and our users can provide more flexible forms of input that we can parse using string operations in our code.&#xA;For the rest of this course, weâ€™ll be using increasingly complex forms of input and output, so knowing how to handle parsing and converting those inputs into the data types we need is a very important skill to practice.</description>
