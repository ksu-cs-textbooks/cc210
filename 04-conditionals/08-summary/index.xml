    <title>Summary :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/04-conditionals/08-summary/</link>
    <description>In this chapter, we learned all about conditional constructs and how we can use them in our programs. They allow us to build programs that execute different pieces of code depending on inputs provided by the user or the values of variables.&#xA;This is one of the first major steps toward building larger and more complex programs. In fact, once we learn how to write programs that can repeat steps, weâ€™ll have covered all of the basic building blocks of programming!</description>
