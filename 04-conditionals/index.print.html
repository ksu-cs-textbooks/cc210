<h1>Programs as Flowcharts</h1>
<p>We&rsquo;ve created many different computer programs by now, but they have all had one thing in common: they only have a single <em>execution path</em> in the program. This means that, each time we run the program, we&rsquo;ll execute the exact same pieces of code and perform the same operations on each variable. We may have different initial values stored in those variables, but that is really the only difference.</p>
<p>To better visualize this, we can actually think of the <em>execution path</em> of a program just like a flowchart. For example, here is a flowchart showing the execution path of a program that asks the user to input a number and then prints the square of that number.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.1.squared.png" alt="Squared Program Flowchart"></p>
<p>However, what if we&rsquo;d like our programs to be able to perform different actions, depending on the user&rsquo;s input? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be useful?</p>

<h1>Branching Constructs</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a second flowchart. For this program, we&rsquo;ll have the user input a number. If the number is even, we&rsquo;ll output <code>even</code>, but if it is odd, we&rsquo;ll output <code>odd</code>. Let&rsquo;s look at what this program might look like as a flowchart:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.2.evenodd.png" alt="Even Odd Program Flowchart"></p>
<p>This flowchart uses a diamond-shaped block to indicate a decision we&rsquo;d like our computer program to make. Inside the block, we see the Boolean logic expression <code>x % 2 == 0</code>, which will determine whether <code>x</code> is evenly divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span>. If so, the result of the modulo operation would be 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, so the entire statement would evaluate to <code>true</code>, indicating that <code>x</code> is an even number.</p>
<p>We also see two arrows coming from this block, one on the left if the statement is <code>false</code>, and another, on the right, if the statement is <code>true</code>. Each path leads to a different output, before being joined together at the end.</p>
<p>Nearly every programming language supports a method for running different parts of code based on the result of some Boolean logic expression, just like in this example. Collectively, these methods are known as <em>conditional constructs</em>, sometimes referred to as <em>conditional statements</em> or just <em>conditionals</em>. In the example above, the diamond-shaped block represents a <em>conditional construct</em> in that program.</p>

<p>Of course, we can make even more complicated decisions in our programs. Let&rsquo;s take a look at one more flowchart and see if we can understand what this program does:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.2.big.png" alt="Big Flowchart"></p>
<p>At first glance, this flowchart may seem quite confusing. However, by looking closely at the decisions it makes and the corresponding output, we should realize that it is a program that plays the common 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&ldquo;Rock, Paper, Scissors&rdquo;</a> game.</p>
<p>First, the program accepts two inputs, representing the symbols chosen by each player, and stores them in variables <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>. Then, it checks to see if the inputs are equal. If so, the program declares the game to be a tie by outputting <code>tie</code>, and then it ends. If the inputs are not equal, then it can determine a winner.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to describe how the rest of the program works, let&rsquo;s look at a few possible inputs and trace the program&rsquo;s execution through the flowchart, just to see what it does.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at the case when player 1 chooses &ldquo;rock&rdquo; and player 2 chooses &ldquo;paper&rdquo;. So, our variables would be <code>p1 = &quot;rock&quot;</code> and <code>p2 = &quot;paper&quot;</code>. Here&rsquo;s a trace of the path that input would follow through the flowchart:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.2.bigrockpaper.png" alt="Rock Paper Flowchart"></p>
<p>As we can see, first the program will check to see if the inputs are equal. Since they are not, it will follow the <code>false</code> branch to the left. Then, it will determine if player 1&rsquo;s input was <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code>. Since that is the case, it will follow the <code>true</code> branch to the right. After that, the program will test if <code>p2 == &quot;paper&quot;</code>, which is also true. So, the program will follow the right branch, and output <code>p2 wins</code>. We can see that this output is indeed correct, since the rules of the game states that &ldquo;paper covers rock&rdquo;, meaning that player 2&rsquo;s choice of paper will beat player 1&rsquo;s choice of rock.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at one other example. This time, player 1 chooses &ldquo;scissors&rdquo; and player 2 chooses &ldquo;paper&rdquo;. Here&rsquo;s a flowchart representing our program with those inputs:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.2.bigscissorspaper.png" alt="Scissors Paper Flowchart"></p>
<p>In this example, the program will first decide if the inputs are equal. They are not, so the program will once again follow the <code>false</code> branch to the left. Then, it will test to see if player 1&rsquo;s input was <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code>. In this case, the user input <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code>, so this test is false, and the program will choose the <code>false</code> branch to the left. Next, it will try to determine if player 1&rsquo;s input was <code>&quot;paper&quot;</code>. Since that is also not the case, it will follow the <code>false</code> branch to the left once again. At this point, our program knows that player 1 did not input either <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;paper&quot;</code>, so it can assume that the input must be <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code>. So, it will then check to see if player 2&rsquo;s input was <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code>. This is also false, so it will choose the <code>false</code> branch once again. From earlier, it knows that player 2&rsquo;s input is different from player 1, and player 2 did not input <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code>. Since player 1&rsquo;s input is assumed to be <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code>, that means that player 2 must have chosen <code>&quot;paper&quot;</code> as it is the only valid input left. Therefore, this program has determined that player 1&rsquo;s input was <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code> and player 2&rsquo;s input was <code>&quot;paper&quot;</code>. By the rules of the game, &ldquo;scissors cuts paper&rdquo;, so player 1 wins. Our program will correctly output <code>p1 wins</code>!</p>

    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Making Assumptions &amp; Inferences</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>In the examples above we made a very important assumption, which allowed us to infer information about each user&rsquo;s input. Can you find a possible problem with the programs as shown in the diagrams above?</p>
<p>In those examples, we assumed that the users would only input either <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;paper&quot;</code>, or <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code>. Based on that assumption, if we have determined that a player&rsquo;s input was neither <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code> nor <code>&quot;paper&quot;</code>, as we did in the last example, then we can infer that the user must have chosen <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>However, we did not <em>specify</em> how that assumption was enforced in our diagram. In a real-world program, how to handle bad input is often specified, and that leads to additional decision boxes that test each user&rsquo;s input against a list of valid inputs before accepting it. This would make the flowchart significantly larger and more complex, which is why they were omitted for this example.</p>
<p>As you complete the programming examples and projects in this course, you&rsquo;ll need to pay special attention to the program&rsquo;s specifications and any assumptions you make about possible user inputs. It will often be the case that <b>no</b> instruction is provided covering the bad input.  In this case you should do nothing.  Adding unspecified features is a bad programming practice&ndash;in formal development a &ldquo;bug&rdquo; would be opened to fix the specification, then you would code to the corrected spec.</p>
<p>For production code, i.e. not one-time-use-for-a-grade code, it is always better to specify how a program handles invalid input instead of relying on assumptions about what your users may or may not provide as input.</p>
<p>The customer may always be right, but users should never be trusted to follow instructions!</p>

<p>As we can see, the ability to make decisions in a computer program is one of the most important building blocks we need to build more elaborate and complex programs. In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll learn about all of the different ways we can write computer programs to make decisions and perform different actions based on those decisions using conditional constructs.</p>

<h1>If Statements</h1>
<p>The first type of conditional construct we&rsquo;ll cover is the <strong>If</strong> statement. This type of statement allows us to build a block of code which will only be executed if the given Boolean expression evaluates to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple flowchart that shows an <strong>If</strong> statement as the conditional construct:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.3.ifthen.png" alt="If Flowchart"></p>
<p>This flowchart represents a program which will ask the user for a number as input, then print that number as output only if the number is greater than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>. Then, the program will print <code>Goodbye</code> and terminate. So, if the user inputs <code>-5</code>, the program will only print <code>Goodbye</code>. However, if the user inputs <code>7</code>, then the program will first print <code>7</code> followed by <code>Goodbye</code>. As we can see, the program will execute the section of code that prints the value of the variable if and only if the value of <code>x &gt; 0</code> is <code>true</code>. Otherwise, it will skip that code and continue with the rest of the program.</p>
<p>Notice that this statement does not include any operations in the case that <code>x &gt; 0</code> is <code>false</code>. Instead, the <code>false</code> branch points downward, and merges with the <code>true</code> branch after the program outputs the value of <code>x</code>. This is the main difference between an <strong>If</strong> statement and an <strong>If-Else</strong> statement, which we&rsquo;ll cover on the next page.</p>
<p>Most programming languages implement an <strong>If</strong> statement in a format similar to this:</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;after code block&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The program is initially executing code in the <code>&lt;before code block&gt;</code> section. Once it reaches the <code>if</code> keyword, it will then evaluate the <code>&lt;Boolean expression&gt;</code> to a value of either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. If the expression is <code>true</code>, then it will execute the code in the <code>&lt;if code block&gt;</code>, followed by the code in the <code>&lt;after code block&gt;</code>. If the expression is <code>false</code>, the program will simply continue executing code in the <code>&lt;after code block&gt;</code>, bypassing the other block entirely.</p>

    <div class="box-content">
<p>You may see the <b>IF</b> statement referred to as the <b>IF-THEN</b> statement.  At the dawn of high level programming languages (1957), there was Fortran.  FORTRAN (original syntax) was the first commercially available high level programming language; it is still in use today in many scientific and mathematics heavy applications.  Its syntax for this structure is</p>

<p>In the early 1970s a new high level programming language, &ldquo;C&rdquo;, enters the ecosystem and it would come to dominate the programming landscape by the 1990s.  C remains in active development, has a huge industry code base and greatly influenced the syntax and style of later languages.  Notably, C dropped the &ldquo;THEN&rdquo;.</p>

<h1>If-Else Statements</h1>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s look at the <strong>If-Else</strong> statement. This statement allows us to choose between two different blocks of code, one to be executed when the Boolean logic expression evaluates to <code>true</code>, and a different block if the expression evaluates to <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple flowchart that shows an <strong>If-Else</strong> statement as the conditional construct:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.4.ifthenelse.png" alt="If-Else Flowchart"></p>
<p>This program is very similar to the one shown on the previous page, with one major difference. Once again, this program will ask the user for a number as input, then print that number as output if the number is greater than or equal to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>. However, if the input value is less than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, the program will instead print the inverse of that value by multiplying it by 
<span class="math align-center">$ -1 $</span> before printing. Finally, the program will print <code>Goodbye</code> and terminate. So, if the user inputs <code>7</code>, the program will just print <code>7</code> followed by <code>Goodbye</code>. However, if the user inputs <code>-5</code>, then the program will calculate 
<span class="math align-center">$ -1 * -5 $</span> and print <code>5</code>, followed by <code>Goodbye</code>. As we can see, the program will choose which block of code to execute depending on the Boolean value that results from evaluating <code>x &gt;= 0</code>. Once it has executed one of those two blocks, then the program will continue with the rest of the code.</p>
<p>Most programming languages implement an <strong>If-Else</strong> statement in a format similar to this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;before code block&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>IF (Boolean expression){ 
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &lt;if code block&gt; or &lt;True code block&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>ELSE {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &lt;else code block&gt; or &lt;False code block&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;after code block&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The program is initially executing code in the <code>&lt;before code block&gt;</code> section. Once it reaches the <code>if</code> keyword, it will then evaluate the <code>&lt;Boolean expression&gt;</code> to a value of either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. If the expression is <code>true</code>, then it will execute the code in the <code>&lt;then code block&gt;</code>, followed by the code in the <code>&lt;after code block&gt;</code>. If the expression is <code>false</code>, the program will execute code in the <code>&lt;else code block&gt;</code>, followed by the code in the <code>&lt;after code block&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that it is impossible for the program to execute both the <code>&lt;True code block&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;False code block&gt;</code> during any single execution of the program. It must choose one block or the other, but it cannot do both. So, if we want each block to perform the same action, we&rsquo;ll have to include the appropriate code in both blocks.</p>

<h1>Tracing &amp; Testing Branches</h1>
<!-- TODO Rewrite & Simplify? -->
<h2 id="testing-for-complete-coverage">Testing for complete coverage</h2>
<p>Every program should be tested.  Better test sets, the set of different inputs against which a program should be tested, ensure that every line of code is reached (executed) at least once when all tests have been run.  This is referred to as test coverage.</p>
<h3 id="complete-coverage">&ldquo;Complete&rdquo; coverage</h3>
<p>Consider</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>1   a &lt;- INPUT(some integer)
2   b &lt;- &#34;&#34;
3   IF (a % 2 == 0) 
4   {
5     b &lt;- &#34;not&#34;
6   }
7   DISPLAY( a + &#34; is &#34;+ b + &#34;even&#34;)
</code></pre><p>If &ldquo;1&rdquo; is entered for line one, the trace of the program is {1,2,3,7}.  Since 1%2 is <code>1</code>, the body of the if statement is skipped. Thus a test set of {{1}} provides 4/7 or 57% coverage.</p>
<p>If &ldquo;2&rdquo; is entered the trace of the program is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. Since 1%2 is <code>0</code>, the body of the if statement is executed.  Thus a test set of {{2}} seems to provide full coverage.</p>
<h4 id="using-2">Using {{2}}</h4>
<p>Lets follow what happens</p>
<ol>
<li>line 1 &ndash; a is assigned the value <code>1</code></li>
<li>line 2 &ndash; b is assigned the value &quot;&quot; (the empty string)</li>
<li>line 3 &ndash; 2 % 2 is 0, so we go into the IF-body</li>
<li>lines 4, 5 &ndash; b is assigned the value &ldquo;not&rdquo;</li>
<li>line 6 &ndash; exit IF body</li>
<li>line 7 &ndash; prints &quot; 2 is not even&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>ER, okay lets fix the program and re-run</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>1   a &lt;- INPUT(some integer)
2   b &lt;- &#34;&#34;
3   IF (a % 2 == 0) 
4   {
5     b &lt;- &#34;&#34;
6   }
7   DISPLAY( a + &#34; is &#34;+ b + &#34;even&#34;)
</code></pre><h4 id="using-2-redux">Using {{2}} Redux</h4>
<p>Lets follow what happens</p>
<ol>
<li>line 1 &ndash; a is assigned the value <code>1</code></li>
<li>line 2 &ndash; b is assigned the value &quot;&quot; (the empty string)</li>
<li>line 3 &ndash; 2 % 2 is 0, so we go into the IF-body</li>
<li>lines 4, 5 &ndash; b is assigned the value &quot;&quot;</li>
<li>line 6 &ndash; exit IF body</li>
<li>line 7 &ndash; prints &ldquo;2 is even&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>Success?  We have 100% coverage on the lines of code and the right answer, but we are not done.</p>
<h2 id="boundary-values">Boundary values</h2>
<p>The problem is 100% code coverage is <b>necessary but not sufficient</b> to ensure a good test set.</p>
<p>This introduces the concept of boundary values. The condition <code>(a % 2 == 0)</code> creates a boundary where some values will go into the IF-body and some will skip it.  It is also <b>necessary but not sufficient</b> to test both sides of every boundary.</p>
<p>We need a value for a that will make  <code>(a % 2 == 0)</code> false.  Lets choose <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>Checking 3 reveals we have a problem, as the result is &ldquo;3 is even&rdquo;.  This leads to another quick fix.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>1   a &lt;- INPUT(some integer)
2   b &lt;- &#34;not&#34;
3   IF (a % 2 == 0) 
4   {
5     b &lt;- &#34;&#34;
6   }
7   DISPLAY( a + &#34; is &#34;+ b + &#34;even&#34;)
</code></pre><p>Finally, using the the test set {{2}, {3}} we get the correct answers, have complete code coverage and have tested every boundary.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle note">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Boundary Values</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Sometimes it is infeasible to use all boundary values.  Consider <code>IF (a&lt;b){...}</code> where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are integers. There are an infinite number of a,b combinations to test&ndash;testing all of these conditions is not realistic.  Making sure you test at least once where a&lt;b and once where a≥b should be the minimum.</p>
<p>However, when one side of a comparison is a constant number, such as the <code>1</code> in <code>a/b &gt; 1</code>.  It is generally considered a good idea to test values at the boundary and slightly outside the boundary.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="perfect-testing-is-impossible">Perfect Testing Is Impossible</h2>
<p>Except for the most trivial programs, it is impossible to exhaustively test a program for correctness. However, using boundary testing and coverage testing as a guide, you will be able to develop fairly robust test sets for CC-210.</p>
<p>In practice exhaustive comprehensive testing is not even attempted.   There is a type of programming, called high-assurance or safety-critical that uses specialized languages, structures and techniques to logically prove certain properties are always true.  The symbolic math and logic background required for this types of programming lies beyond the scope of the Computational Core program.</p>

</code></pre><p>It would have been obvious that {2} did not provide complete coverage, maybe we would have come up with {{2},{3}} faster.</p>
<h3 id="should-you-avoid-complex-conditions">Should you avoid complex conditions?</h3>

<h1>Other Branching Statements</h1>
<p>Many programming languages also provide other conditional constructs that perform these same operations in different ways. However, each of these constructs can also be built using just <strong>If</strong> and <strong>If-Else</strong> statements, so it is not necessary to use these constructs themselves to achieve the desired result. In many cases, they are simply provided as a convenience to the programmer in order to make the code simpler or easier to understand.</p>
<h2 id="jump-tables">Jump Tables</h2>
<p>In assembly and machine-code there are control structures known as jump- or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_table">branch-tables</a>. Conceptually, when the program arrives at a branch table, it looks at the current value of a variable and then executes exactly one row of the table based on that value. Each row of the table is an independent &ldquo;code block&rdquo;, and only on row can be executed.  Kind of like trains entering a rail-yard^[Actual assembly/machine level implementation is done with off-sets and unconditional jumps, hence the name jump table.].</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/Railyard.png" alt="Rail yard"></p>
<p>The key concept is each value follows exactly one path.</p>
<h3 id="switch">Switch</h3>
<p>Some programming languages, such as C and Java, include a special type of conditional construct known as a <strong>Switch Statement</strong>, sometimes referred to as a <strong>Case Statement</strong>. Instead of using a Boolean value, which can only be <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, a <strong>Switch Statement</strong> allows our program to choose a block of code to execute based on the many possible values of a variable, traditionally an integer value.</p>
<p>This flowchart shows what a switch statement might look like in a program:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.5.switch.png" alt="Switch Statement Flowchart"></p>
<p>In this example, the program will examine the value of the variable <code>x</code> and use it to choose a <strong>case</strong>, which is a code block that would be executed. Here, it would simply output a different response, depending on the value of <code>x</code>. Notice that the flowchart is essentially using several <strong>If</strong> statements to accomplish this task, which is essentially what the computer would do when executing this program. In addition, the program includes a special <strong>default</strong> case, which is executed if the value of <code>x</code> does not match any of the other cases.</p>
<p>In code, a <strong>Switch Statement</strong> may have this general structure:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>switch &lt;variable&gt;:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  case &lt;value 1&gt;: &lt;code block 1&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  case &lt;value 2&gt;: &lt;code block 2&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  case &lt;value 3&gt;: &lt;code block 3&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  ...
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  default: &lt;default code block&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Depending on the programming language used, it <em>is</em> possible to execute multiple code blocks inside a <strong>Switch Statement</strong>, so we may need to consult the documentation for our chosen programming language to understand how these statements work.</p>
<h3 id="if-else-if">IF-ELSE-IF</h3>
<p>The Switch flow chart can also be implemented with nested IF statements.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/SwitchIF.png" alt="Switch Statement Flowchart"></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>x &lt;- Input
IF (x == 1){
    DISPLAY(A)
    }
ELSE {
   IF (x == 2){
        DISPLAY(B)
   }
   ELSE{
       IF (x ==3){
           DISPLAY(C)
       }
       ELSE {
           DISPLAY(Error!)
       }
   }
}
</code></pre><p>Using IF-ELSE-IF allows more flexibility (like ranges of values) in the jumps.</p>
<p>An important feature of the jump table is every possible value is assigned an execution path.  This is the purpose of the &ldquo;default&rdquo;-case or final &ldquo;ELSE&rdquo;.  These paths often display some type error message indicating that an unexpected value was encountered.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Convention &amp; Jump Tables</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p><b>ALWAYS</b> include a default-case or final ELSE which contains the logic for what to do when a value is not in the expected range.  Often time you will terminate the program if this happens.</p>
<p>It is always acceptable to use IF-ELSE-IF.  This communicates clearly that the original programmer expected a mutually exclusive branching, and comprehensively dealt with all expected outcomes.  If some future modifier of the code reaches this statement, they  know they too must deal with every possible case; i.e. leave no &ldquo;holes&rdquo; in the logic.</p>
<p>Use of Switch is more language idiosyncratic.  In some language implementations, the &ldquo;case&rdquo; statements are not always mutually exclusive, and this can make the original programmer&rsquo;s intent unclear.  Not all language bother to implement a &ldquo;Switch&rdquo; statement.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="ternary-conditional-operator">Ternary Conditional Operator</h2>
<p>Many programming languages also include a special operator, known as a <strong>Ternary Conditional Operator</strong>, sometimes referred to simply as a <strong>Ternary Operator</strong>, that is effectively a shortcut for a simple <strong>If-Else</strong> statement that produces a single value. Here&rsquo;s a flowchart showing an example:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.5.ternary.png" alt="Ternary Operator Flowchart"></p>
<p>In this example, the program accepts two variables, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, as input. Then, it will set the value of a third variable, <code>z</code>, to the maximum value of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. It does so by testing if <code>x &gt; y</code>. If so, it will set <code>z = x</code>; otherwise it will set <code>z = y</code>.</p>
<p>In general, there are two different ways that this operator is implemented. In Java and other programming languages similar to C, it looks like this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;variable&gt; = &lt;boolean expression&gt; ? &lt;true expression&gt; : &lt;false expression&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In Python, the ternary conditional operator looks just a bit different:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span>variable<span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span>true expression<span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span>boolean expression<span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span>false expression<span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>

    <div class="box-content">
<p>The appropriate use of the ternary operator is hotly debated&ndash;this may be a sad commentary on what passes for excitement in the programming field. If it is used, it should be used to make reading the code more clear.  The code <code>a = a if a&gt;0 else -a</code> can be understood to find the absolute value of <code>a</code>.</p>
<p>Some monstrosity like <code>a = foo(b) &gt;= bar (c) ? f(b&gt;c?2.0 * c:b+1) : g(c)!=1 ? ++c:c+1;</code> is better written in if-else statements.</p>
<p>We suggest that if you use the ternary operator, be very judicious in its application. You may want to read the article in

<h1>If Statement</h1>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered many different types of conditional constructs, let&rsquo;s dive right in and see how they can be used in Java.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at the <strong>If</strong> statement. In Java, the syntax for an <strong>If</strong> statement is shown below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span><span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;</span>Boolean expression<span style="color:#f92672">&gt;){</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">true</span> block<span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As expected, Java will first evaluate the <code>&lt;Boolean expression&gt;</code> to a single Boolean value. If that value is <code>true</code>, it will execute the instructions in the <code>&lt;true block&gt;</code>, which can be one or more lines of code, or even additional constructs as we&rsquo;ll see later. If that value is <code>false</code>, then the program will simply skip over the <code>&lt;true block&gt;</code> and continue executing the code immediately below the <strong>If</strong> statement.</p>
<p>It is very important to remember that the Boolean expression is enclosed by parentheses <code>( )</code>, while the block of code that should be executed if that expression is <code>true</code> is enclosed by curly braces <code>{ }</code>, just like a class body or method body.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a few code examples, just to see how this construct works in practice. First, let&rsquo;s consider the program represented by this flowchart from earlier in the chapter:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.3.ifthen.png" alt="If-Then Flowchart"></p>
<p>This flowchart corresponds to the following code in Java. In this case, we&rsquo;ll assume <code>x</code> is hard-coded for now:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 1<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>x <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> 0<span style="color:#f92672">){</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>x<span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Goodbye&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we can see, this program uses <code>x &gt; 0</code> as the Boolean expression inside of the <strong>If</strong> statement. If it is <code>true</code>, then it will output the value of <code>x</code>. So, it is very simple to write code that matches the execution paths shown in a flowchart representing the program.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one more example. Let&rsquo;s assume we&rsquo;d like to write a program that will calculate both the sum and product of two variables, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, but only if they are both greater than 0. That program may look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 5<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 7<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we can see, we can create more complex Boolean statements using the various Boolean operators we&rsquo;ve already learned. In addition, we can include multiple lines of code inside the curly braces.</p>

In essence, the <strong>If-Else</strong> statement simply adds a second code block and the <code>else</code> keyword after an <strong>If-</strong> statement.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a few code examples, just to see how this construct works in practice. First, let&rsquo;s consider the program represented by this flowchart from earlier in the chapter:</p>

If it is <code>false</code>, the program will output the value <code>(-1 * x)</code>, which represents the inverse of <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one more example. In this program, we&rsquo;d like to calculate the difference between two numbers, but we&rsquo;d only like to output a positive number. So, our code may look something like this:</p>

<p>Beyond that, it can be very difficult to read code that is not properly indented, regardless of the use of curly braces. So, it is a best practice to always include curly braces in your conditional statements and indent each block, even if those changes aren&rsquo;t necessarily required in some cases.</p>

<h1>Variable Scope</h1>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve learned how to create new code blocks in our programs using constructs such as the <strong>If-Then</strong> and <strong>If-Then-Else</strong> statements, we must take a minute to discuss one of the major limitations of those code blocks.</p>
<p>The <em>scope</em> of a variable refers to the possible areas in a program&rsquo;s code where that variable can be accessed and used. This is very important to understand once we begin introducing additional code blocks in our programs, because variables declared inside of a code block cannot be accessed outside of that block.</p>
<h2 id="local-variable-scope-in-java">Local Variable Scope in Java</h2>
<p>In general, Java follows these rules when determining if a local variable is accessible.</p>
<ol>
<li>A local variable in Java <strong>may not</strong> be accessed before it is first declared.</li>
<li>A local variable in Java <strong>may not</strong> be accessed outside of the code block in which it is declared.</li>
<li>A local variable in Java <strong>may</strong> be accessed inside of any code blocks placed inside of the code block in which is declared.</li>
<li>A local variable in Java <strong>may not</strong> have the same name as an existing variable contained in an enclosing code block.</li>
</ol>
<p>Later on in this course we&rsquo;ll learn about class member variables, which have some different rules that govern their scope. For now, we&rsquo;ll only worry about local variables, which are variables declared within a method body.</p>
<h2 id="accessing-before-declaring">Accessing Before Declaring</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a few examples for each rule. First, a variable may not be accessed before it is declared. So, we cannot do the following:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That example will compile and run as expected.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the Java compiler is advanced enough to determine if a variable would be initialized by all possible paths, as in this example:</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This example will compile and run without any problems, since the variable <code>y</code> is initialized in both blocks of the <strong>If-Else</strong> statement. In short, there is no possible execution path that does not initialize <code>y</code>, so it is accepted by the compiler.</p>
<h2 id="accessing-inside-a-code-block">Accessing Inside a Code Block</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen several examples of this already, but here&rsquo;s a clear example of accessing a variable from a code block within the block where the variable was declared:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">static</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>String<span style="color:#f92672">[]</span> args<span style="color:#f92672">){</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, the variable <code>x</code> is declared inside of the <code>main</code> method&rsquo;s body. Then, it is accessed inside of the body of the <strong>If</strong> statement, which is itself within the body of the <code>main</code> method. Later in this chapter we&rsquo;ll see examples of chaining and nesting conditional constructs, which will give us more examples of how this works.</p>
<h2 id="same-variable-names">Same Variable Names</h2>
<p>Finally, Java does not allow us to use the same variable name twice in the same code block, or in any code blocks enclosed within that block. For example, we could try to do something like this:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If so, the compiler will detect that we&rsquo;ve already declared variable <code>x</code> in the <code>main</code> method body, so it won&rsquo;t allow us to declare it again inside the <strong>If-Then</strong> statement&rsquo;s body.

<p>Lastly, while we cannot use the same variable name as an existing variable, we can use that name later on in our program, as long as there is not already a variable declared with the same name that is accessible. Here&rsquo;s an example of that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">static</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>String<span style="color:#f92672">[]</span> args<span style="color:#f92672">){</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Surprisingly, this program will compile and run without any errors. In this case, we are allowed to declare a variable named <code>y</code> inside of the <strong>If</strong> statement&rsquo;s code block because we have not yet declared a variable with that name anywhere in our program. Later, we are allowed to declare another variable named <code>y</code>, this time directly within the <code>main</code> method&rsquo;s body. This is because we are outside of the <strong>If</strong> statement&rsquo;s code block, so the previously declared variable named <code>y</code> no longer exists. So, we can reuse the name here without causing any problems.</p>
<p>However, this is <em><strong>widely</strong></em> regarded as poor coding practice, as it may make our code very difficult to read and understand. So, it is always better to try and avoid reusing variable names whenever possible, just to make it clear in our code which to variable we are referring.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful features of the conditional constructs we&rsquo;ve covered so far in this course is the ability to chain them together or nest them within each other to achieve remarkably useful program structures. The ability to use conditional constructs effectively is one of the most powerful skills to develop as a programmer.</p>
<h2 id="zero-one-negative-one">Zero, One, Negative One</h2>
<p>A great example of the many ways to structure a program using conditional constructs is building a simple program that does three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>If <code>x</code> is less than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, output <code>-1</code></li>
<li>If <code>x</code> is equal to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, output <code>0</code></li>
<li>If <code>x</code> is greater than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, output <code>1</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at two different ways we could structure this program using the conditional constructs we&rsquo;ve already learned.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle tip">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Try It!</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>See if you can build each of these examples in <code>Conditionals.java</code> file, which is open in to the left. Doing so is a great way to get additional practice working with conditional constructs.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to add the correct class declaration to the file as well! It is not included in the code examples below.</p>

<h2 id="chaining-if-statements">Chaining If Statements</h2>
<p>First, we could chain together several <strong>If</strong> statements to create this program. As a flowchart, the program might look like this:</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s one way that program could be written in Java. Once again, we&rsquo;re just using hard-coded variables for now:</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Just like we see in the flowchart, this program contains three <strong>If</strong> statements chained together, one after another. If we run this program with various inputs, we should see that it produces the expected result.</p>
<h2 id="nesting-if-then-else-statements">Nesting If-Then-Else Statements</h2>
<p>Next, we can achieve the same result using <strong>If-Else</strong> statements. Here&rsquo;s what that program would look like as as flowchart:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.7.x.3.nesting.png" alt="Nesting If-Then-Else Statements"></p>
<p>We can also write that program in Java. Here&rsquo;s one possible way to do it:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we&rsquo;ve nested an <strong>If-Else</strong> statement inside of the second block of another <strong>If-Else</strong> statement. So, if the first Boolean expression, <code>x &lt; 0</code>, is <code>true</code>, we&rsquo;ll output <code>-1</code> and end the program. However, if it is <code>false</code>, we&rsquo;ll go into the <code>false</code> branch of the first statement. Then, we&rsquo;ll see another Boolean expression, <code>x == 0</code>. If that expression is <code>true</code>, we&rsquo;ll output <code>0</code>. Otherwise, we&rsquo;ll output <code>1</code>. Once again, this program should produce the correct result.</p>
<p>Of course, we could include a third <strong>If-Else</strong> statement, as shown in this example:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we discussed earlier in this chapter, we can safely infer that <code>x</code> must be greater than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span> based on the two previous Boolean expressions. However, what if we&rsquo;ve made a logic error in our program, and that assumption is not valid? By including the last <strong>If-Else</strong> statement, we can have our program print an error in the unlikely chance that the value of <code>x</code> is not properly handled by any other option.</p>
<p>In fact, here&rsquo;s how easy it is to cause just that sort of logic error. Consider the following example:</p>

    <div class="box-content">
<p>Can you spot the logic error in the example above? Try running the code with different values for <code>x</code> and see what happens.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>In this example, we&rsquo;ve updated the Boolean expression in the first <strong>If-Else</strong> statement to <code>x &lt; -1</code>. Similarly, we&rsquo;ve changed the Boolean expression in the third statement to <code>x &gt; 1</code>. That change seems logical, right?</p>
<p>What if the value of <code>x</code> is exactly 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> or 
<span class="math align-center">$ -1 $</span>? In that case, it will fail all three logic expressions, and the program will output <code>ERROR!</code> instead. By including the third <strong>If-Else</strong> statement, we can detect logic errors that may not easily be found otherwise. Without that statement, the program would most likely output <code>1</code> even when the input is <code>-1</code>, which is clearly a negative number.</p>
<p>So, in many cases, it may be better to include additional <strong>If-Else</strong> statements to explicitly check all possible cases, instead of relying on assumptions and inferences, which may lead to unintended logic errors.</p>
<h2 id="inline-nesting">Inline Nesting</h2>
<p>Finally, it is acceptable to minimize nested <strong>If-Else</strong> statements if the nested statement is exclusively in the <code>false</code> branch. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Many programming languages refer to this structure as an <strong>If-Else If-Else</strong> statement. In this program, if the first Boolean expression is <code>false</code>, it immediately moves to the next Boolean expression following the first set of <code>else if</code> keywords. The process continues until one Boolean expression evaluates to <code>true</code>, or the final <code>else</code> keyword is reached. In that case, we know that none of the Boolean expressions evaluated to <code>true</code>, so the final <code>false</code> branch is executed.</p>
<p>While other programming languages include an explicit keyword for <code>else if</code>, Java does not. Instead, we are simply omitting the curly braces that surround the <code>false</code> block on each <strong>If-Else</strong> statement. The Java compiler treats the entire <strong>If-Else</strong> statement contained in that block as a single line, so the curly braces are not explicitly required in this case.</p>
<p>This is the one and only case where it is acceptable to remove those unnecessary curly braces in most Java style guides. Some programmers find this inline structure simpler to read and follow, as it avoids the problem of code being nested several layers deep. Others feel that it is dangerous to remove any explicit curly braces, and prefer the nested structure instead.</p>

<p>It should be obvious that only one branch of an <strong>If-Else If-Else</strong> will ever be executed; that is the branches are mutually exclusive.  It is a excellent practice always use <strong>If-Else If-Else</strong> whenever you know the logic should be exclusive.  Consider the  Goldilocks Porridge Temperature Tester.</p>

<h1>Switch Statement</h1>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s look at the <strong>Switch Statement</strong> in Java. As we learned earlier, this statement allows our programs to choose branches based on any number of possible values of a variable. Here&rsquo;s a flowchart showing what such a program might look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.5.switch.png" alt="Switch Statement"></p>
<p>In Java, we could write that program in many ways. This is one possible solution:</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this program, the switch statement will evaluate the value of <code>x</code>, then look for the <code>case</code> keyword that exactly matches that value. In this example, <code>x == 2</code>, so it will choose the second case and output <code>B</code>.</p>
<p>If we change the value of <code>x</code> to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>, then we can see that none of the <code>case</code> keywords match. In that instance, the program will instead choose the <code>default</code> case and print <code>Error!</code>.</p>
<h2 id="fall-through">Fall Through</h2>
<p>The switch statement above introduces a new keyword, <code>break</code>, which we&rsquo;ll cover in detail in a later chapter. The <code>break</code> keyword causes the program to stop executing code in the current statement, and the continue executing the code following that statement. So, when the program reaches a <code>break</code> statement in the example above, it stops executing any additional code in the <strong>Switch Statement</strong> and continues running the code following that statement.</p>
<p>It is possible to create a switch statement that does not include <code>break</code> keywords. In that statement, it will continue executing any cases below the chosen case until it reaches the end of the statement or the <code>default</code> keyword.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;d like to write a program that will print all the numbers from a given starting number up to 5. So, we could use a <strong>Switch Statement</strong> to do that as in this program:</p>

<h1>Ternary Statement</h1>
<p>Java also includes the <strong>Ternary Conditional Operator</strong>, which can be used as a shortcut for an <strong>If-Else</strong> statement.</p>
<p>First, consider the flowchart we saw earlier in this chapter:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this program, the expression <code>(x &gt; y) ? x : y;</code> is the <strong>Ternary Conditional Operator</strong>. It first calculates the value of the Boolean expression <code>(x &gt; y)</code>. If that expression is <code>true</code>, then the entire expression evaluates to <code>x</code>. If it is <code>false</code>, then the expression evaluates to <code>y</code>. So, if we compile and run this program, it should output <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>We can also include the <strong>Ternary Conditional Operator</strong> anywhere we&rsquo;d normally use a value. This is because, just like any other operator, the <strong>Ternary Conditional Operator</strong> results in a single value when evaluated. For example, it could be used directly within the <code>println()</code> method:</p>

<h1>Subgoals</h1>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve seen how to work with conditional constructs in Java, let&rsquo;s break down our thought process a bit into subgoals once again.</p>
<h2 id="evaluating-conditional-constructs">Evaluating Conditional Constructs</h2>
<p>Here are the subgoals we can use for evaluating conditional constructs:</p>
<h3 id="1-diagram-which-statements-go-together">1. Diagram Which Statements Go Together</h3>
<p>First, when we see a conditional construct in code, we must determine which statements go together. Specifically, we need to know which statements are in the <code>true</code> branch, and which statements are in the <code>false</code> branch. This may seem pretty straightforward, but if the code contains many nested statements or poor formatting, it can be very difficult to do.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">true</span><span style="color:#f92672">){</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">false</span><span style="color:#f92672">){</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;one&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;two&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we see that there are three distinct branches. First, we have the <code>true</code> branch of the outermost <strong>If-Else</strong> statement, which includes the inner <strong>If</strong> statement. That statement itself has a <code>true</code> branch that will print <code>one</code> to the terminal. The outermost statement also has a <code>false</code> branch, which will print <code>two</code> to the terminal.</p>
<h3 id="2-determine-if-boolean-expression-is-true-or-false">2. Determine if Boolean Expression is <code>true</code> or <code>false</code></h3>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve identified our conditional construct, the next step is to determine if the Boolean expression inside of the <code>if</code> statement is <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Sometimes this step is simple, but other times it can be tricky. Thankfully, we can refer back to the subgoals we&rsquo;ve already seen for evaluating expressions if we need a bit of help.</p>
<h3 id="3-follow-the-correct-branch">3. Follow the Correct Branch</h3>
<p>After we find the value of the Boolean expression, we can simply follow the <code>true</code> branch if the Boolean expression evaluated to <code>true</code>. If the Boolean expression evaluated to <code>false</code>, we can follow the <code>false</code> branch if it exists. If the conditional construct is an <strong>If</strong> statement, we can simply ignore the rest of the conditional construct and move on to the next part of the program.</p>
<h2 id="writing-conditional-constructs">Writing Conditional Constructs</h2>
<p>We can also use subgoals to help us write new conditional constructs.</p>
<h3 id="1-define-how-many-mutually-exclusive-paths-are-needed">1. Define How Many Mutually Exclusive Paths are Needed</h3>
<p>First, when building a new conditional construct, we must determine how many paths are needed. In effect, this will be one more than the number of conditional constructs we&rsquo;ll end up using in most cases.</p>
<h3 id="2-order-paths-from-most-restrictiveselective-to-least-restrictive">2. Order Paths from Most Restrictive/Selective to Least Restrictive</h3>
<p>Next, we can reorder the paths from most restrictive to least restrictive. The most restrictive path would be the one that is least likely to occur, while the least restrictive path is the one that will be taken most often. We&rsquo;ll see how this works a bit more clearly in the example on the next page.</p>
<h3 id="3-write-if-statement-with-boolean-expression">3. Write <code>if</code> Statement with Boolean Expression</h3>
<p>Once we have all of our paths identified and ordered, we can start writing our <code>if</code> statements for each path. Each <code>if</code> statement will need a Boolean expression to help us determine which branch to follow. Generally, we&rsquo;ll place the most restrictive paths inside of the less restrictive paths, but it all depends on the problem and what order makes the most sense.</p>
<h3 id="4-write-true-branch-code">4. Write <code>true</code> Branch Code</h3>
<p>Then, for each conditional construct, we must fill in the code on the inside of the <code>true</code> branch. This could be a block of code, or even another conditional construct.</p>
<h3 id="5-write-false-branch-code">5. Write <code>false</code> Branch Code</h3>
<p>Similarly, we must fill in the code on the inside of the <code>false</code> branch, if needed. This could be a block of code, or even another conditional construct.</p>
<h3 id="6-repeat-3-5-for-all-paths">6. Repeat 3-5 For All Paths</h3>
<p>Finally, once we&rsquo;ve created a conditional construct, we may have to repeat these steps again and again for each path that we identified in subgoal 1.</p>
<p>On the next page, we&rsquo;ll see how we can apply these subgoals in a worked example.</p>

<!-- TODO Update Video -->
<p style="color:red;padding:20"><b>Note:</b>  This video uses the terminal input.  We will use command line arguments</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve covered quite a bit of new material so far in this chapter. Let&rsquo;s work through a complete example from start to finish, just to see how we can put all of those pieces together to make a very powerful program.</p>
<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s start with a problem statement. Here&rsquo;s an interesting problem that we can try to solve:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a program that accepts as a command line argument, a positive integer that represents a year, and prints whether that year is a leap year or not. If the year is a leap year, it should print output similar to <code>2000 is a Leap Year</code>. If not, it should print output similar to <code>2001 is not a Leap Year</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this sounds like a simple problem, there are actually several rules we&rsquo;ll have to handle. According to the United States Naval Observatory, the Gregorian calendar (the calendar in use throughout much of the world) calculates whether a year is a leap year based on the following rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is. - 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#cite_note-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ll be writing a program that can handle all of those rules to determine if a year is a leap year or not.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>To begin building this program, we need to first build the basic skeleton of a program. For this example, store your code in <code>Example.java</code>, which should be open in the panel to the left.</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;ll need to include a <em>class declaration</em> and a <em>main method declaration</em> in the file. Our code should be similar to this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Example</span><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">static</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>String<span style="color:#f92672">[]</span> args<span style="color:#f92672">){</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="breaking-down-the-problem-statement">Breaking Down the Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Before we start writing more code, let&rsquo;s break down the problem statement a bit and see how we can use it to help us identify parts of the program we need to write.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s our problem statement again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a program that accepts a positive integer from the command line, that represents a year as a command line argument, and prints whether that year is a leap year or not. If the year is a leap year, it should print output similar to <code>2000 is a Leap Year</code>. If not, it should print output similar to <code>2001 is not a Leap Year</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at this problem statement, we see that we need at least one variable to store the year that is provided as input from the user. Similarly, we need at least one conditional construct, which will allow us to print whether the given year is a leap year or not. Here&rsquo;s the problem statement again, with those parts highlighted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a program that accepts a positive integer (<strong>variable</strong>) from the command line, that represents a year, and prints whether that year is a leap year or not (<strong>conditional construct</strong>). If the year is a leap year (<strong>true branch</strong>), it should print output similar to <code>2000 is a Leap Year</code>. If not (<strong>false branch</strong>), it should print output similar to <code>2001 is not a Leap Year</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, we can look at the second part of the problem statement and break it down as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is. - 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#cite_note-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at this, we see that there are actually three conditional constructs we need to build. Let&rsquo;s mark them in the statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every year that is exactly divisible by four (<strong>conditional construct 1</strong>) is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100 (<strong>conditional construct 2</strong>), but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400 (<strong>conditional construct 3</strong>). For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is. - 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#cite_note-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;ll have to be careful to make sure that each branch of these three conditional statements produces the correct output. Below, we&rsquo;ll see how we can construct code for this problem.</p>
<h2 id="reading-the-command-line">Reading the Command line</h2>
<p>Generally, one of the first things our program should do is process the command line arguments (if any) and store them in appropriately typed variables. In this case, we expect a single integer, so we&rsquo;d add the following line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> year <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Integer<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">parseInt</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>args<span style="color:#f92672">[</span>0<span style="color:#f92672">]);</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#75715e">// MORE CODE GOES HERE  
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once we have that code in place, we are ready to begin working on the actual logic of our program. As before, the examples below will just include the logic portion of the program, which can be placed where the <code>MORE CODE GOES HERE</code> line is in the example above.</p>
<p>However, the problem statement has one very important part in it that we&rsquo;ll need to handle as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a program that accepts a <strong>positive integer</strong> that represents a year&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ll need to make sure the user has input a positive integer into our program. We can do that using a simple <strong>If-Then-Else</strong> statement:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>year <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> 0<span style="color:#f92672">){</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Error&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, we might be tempted to use an <strong>If-Then</strong> statement instead. However, we need to make sure our program only calculates a result if the input is positive. If it is negative, we should just print an error. Since that means our program needs two distinct branches, we should use an <strong>If-Then-Else</strong> statement here.</p>
<h2 id="calculating-output">Calculating Output</h2>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve read our input, we need to calculate our output. Let&rsquo;s handle the three rules one at a time.</p>
<h3 id="divisible-by-hahahugoshortcode-s2-hbhb">Divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span></h3>
<p>For the first rule, we must check to see if the year is divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>. We can use the modulo operator to do this. Remember that the modulo operator performs a division and returns the remainder. So, if the remainder is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, then we know that the number is evenly divisible by the divisor.</p>
<p>In code, we could do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>year <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> 0<span style="color:#f92672">){</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In each of these <strong>If-Then-Else</strong> statements, let&rsquo;s place a quick comment in the code to keep track of what we know within each branch.</p>
<h3 id="not-divisible-by-hahahugoshortcode-s5-hbhb">Not Divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 100 $</span></h3>
<p>Next, we need to handle the rule that any year divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 100 $</span> is not a leap year, even if it is divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>. Of course, we can easily determine mathematically that all years divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 100 $</span> are also divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>, so we don&rsquo;t have to worry about the other case in this instance. So, we can add another <strong>If-Then-Else</strong> to our program:</p>

<h1>If Statement</h1>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered many different types of conditional constructs, let&rsquo;s dive right in and see how they can be used in Python.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at the <strong>If</strong> statement. In Python, the syntax for an <strong>If</strong> statement is shown below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span>Boolean expression<span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">True</span> block<span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As expected, Python will first evaluate the <code>&lt;Boolean expression&gt;</code> to a single Boolean value. If that value is <code>True</code>, it will execute the instructions in the <code>&lt;True block&gt;</code>, which can be one or more lines of code, or even additional constructs as we&rsquo;ll see later. If that value is <code>False</code>, then the program will simply skip over the <code>&lt;True block&gt;</code> and continue executing the code immediately below the <strong>If</strong> statement.</p>
<p>It is very important to remember that the Boolean expression is followed by a colon <code>:</code>, while the block of code that should be executed if that expression is <code>True</code> is indented. We typically use at four spaces for indentation in Python, which is the default in Codio&rsquo;s text editor as well.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Python Indentation</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>One of the trickiest parts of working with Python code is the fact that it uses indentation to determine which lines of code belong to a block. In the example above, we use four spaces in front of lines of code directly below the <strong>If</strong> statement to indent them in order to show that those lines should be executed only if the Boolean expression evaluates to <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>Other languages, such as Java and C, use curly braces <code>{ }</code> and ignore indentation entirely. In this way, even if the spacing in the source code is inconsistent, it can still be read and understood by a compiler.</p>
<p>In Python, however, we must be extremely consistent about indentation, especially as our programs become larger and more complex. It is very easy to cause issues in a program if we accidentally lose track of which level of indentation our code should be using. Because of this, there are a few rules that we should follow as we write code in Python</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a consistent number of spaces for each level of indentation, usually 4 spaces for each level.</li>
<li><strong>NEVER</strong> use the tab character for indentation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thankfully, most text editors, including the one built in to Codio, automatically convert any tab characters to spaces for us. So, when we press the <strong>Tab</strong> key on our keyboard, we are really adding 2 spaces to our file. In that way, we can continue to use that key to indent our code!</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a few code examples, just to see how this construct works in practice. First, let&rsquo;s consider the program represented by this flowchart from earlier in the chapter:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.3.ifthen.png" alt="If-Then Flowchart"></p>
<p>This flowchart corresponds to the following code in Python. In this case, we&rsquo;ll assume <code>x</code> is hard-coded for now:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(x)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Goodbye&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we can see, this program uses <code>x &gt; 0</code> as the Boolean expression inside of the <strong>If</strong> statement. If it is <code>True</code>, then it will output the value of <code>x</code>. Below that, we have another line of code that prints <code>Goodbye</code>, which is not indented. That line will always be executed, regardless of the value of the Boolean expression. That is because it is not a part of the <code>True</code> block that is indented inside of the <strong>If</strong> statement. As we can see, it is very important to pay attention to how our code is indented.</p>
<p>So, it is very simple to write code that matches the execution paths shown in a flowchart representing the program.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one more example. Let&rsquo;s assume we&rsquo;d like to write a program that will calculate both the sum and product of two variables, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, but only if they are both greater than 0. That program may look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (x <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>) <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> (y <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>):
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    sum <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    product <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Sum: &#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> str(sum))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Product: &#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> str(product))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we can see, we can create more complex Boolean statements using the various Boolean operators we&rsquo;ve already learned. In addition, we can include multiple lines of code inside the <strong>If</strong> statement, just by indenting each line to the same level.</p>

<h1>If-Else Statement</h1>
<p>The <strong>If-Else</strong> statement in Python is very similar to the <strong>If</strong> statement. In Python, the syntax for an <strong>If-Else</strong> statement is shown below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span>Boolean expression<span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>:

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As expected, Python will first evaluate the <code>&lt;Boolean expression&gt;</code> to a single Boolean value. If that value is <code>True</code>, it will execute the instructions in the <code>&lt;True block&gt;</code>, which can be one or more lines of code, or even additional constructs as we&rsquo;ll see later. If that value is <code>False</code>, then the program will execute the code in the <code>&lt;False block&gt;</code> instead. In essence, the <strong>If-Else</strong> statement simply adds a second code block and the <code>else</code> keyword after an <strong>If</strong> statement.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a few code examples, just to see how this construct works in practice. First, let&rsquo;s consider the program represented by this flowchart from earlier in the chapter:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.4.ifthenelse.png" alt="If-Then-Else Flowchart"></p>
<p>This flowchart corresponds to the following code in Python. In this case, we&rsquo;ll assume <code>x</code> is hard-coded for now:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Goodbye&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we can see, this program uses <code>x &gt;= 0</code> as the Boolean logic expression inside of the <strong>If-Else</strong> statement. If it is <code>True</code>, then it will output the value of <code>x</code>. If it is <code>False</code>, the program will output the value <code>(-1 * x)</code>, which represents the inverse of <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one more example. In this program, we&rsquo;d like to calculate the difference between two numbers, but we&rsquo;d only like to output a positive number. So, our code may look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>

<h1>Variable Scope</h1>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve learned how to create new code blocks in our programs using constructs such as the <strong>If</strong> and <strong>If-Else</strong> statements, we must take a minute to discuss one concept related to those code blocks.</p>
<p>The <em>scope</em> of a variable refers to the possible areas in a program&rsquo;s code where that variable can be accessed and used. This is very important to understand once we begin introducing additional code blocks in our programs, because it can affect where we can access those variables.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Python Variable Initialization</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>When a variable in Python is created, we say that it is <em>initialized</em>. So, a line of code like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>is a <em>variable initialization</em> if that is the first time the value <code>x</code> has appeared in our code. Some other languages include <em>variable declarations</em> that work in a similar way, so we may see that term used as well.</p>
<p>When discussing variable scope, it is important to know where the variable is <em>initialized</em> in the code. So, we&rsquo;ll see this term used often in this section.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="variable-scope-in-python">Variable Scope in Python</h2>
<p>In general, Python follows these rules when determining if a global variable is accessible.</p>
<ol>
<li>A variable in Python <strong>may not</strong> be accessed before it is first initialized.</li>
<li>A variable in Python <strong>may</strong> be accessed outside of the code block in which it is initialized, provided that the code was executed.</li>
<li>A variable in Python <strong>may</strong> be accessed inside of any code blocks placed inside of the code block in which is initialized.</li>
</ol>
<p>Later on in this course we&rsquo;ll learn about class member variables and local variables, which have some different rules that govern their scope. For now, we&rsquo;ll only worry about global variables, which are variables initialized outside of a class or method in Python.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-before-declaring">Accessing Before Declaring</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a few examples for each rule. First, a variable may not be accessed before it is initialized. So, we cannot do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(a)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(a)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If we do, the interpreter will output an error similar to the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>NameError: name &#39;a&#39; is not defined
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Instead, we must make sure the variable is initialized before it is accessed, as in this correct example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(a)
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="accessing-outside-code-block">Accessing Outside Code Block</h3>
<p>Next, here&rsquo;s an example where the code is trying to access a variable outside of the code block where it is initially initialized:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(y)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this instance, the program will work correctly. Since <code>x &lt; 10</code> is <code>True</code>, the program will set a value for <code>y</code>, and we can then print it later in our program, even outside of the code block where <code>y</code> was initialized.</p>
<p>However, if we have not executed that code block, we cannot use the variable. Here&rsquo;s a second example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">15</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(y)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we try to run this program, the interpreter gives us the following error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>NameError: name &#39;y&#39; is not defined
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So, if we cannot predict the value of <code>x</code> beforehand, it is impossible for us to know if <code>y</code> will actually be available or not. To solve that problem, we can initialize our variable <code>y</code> outside of the <strong>If</strong> statement&rsquo;s code block and give it a reasonable default value, as in this corrected example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">15</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(y)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That example will execute properly for any value of <code>x</code>, because we made sure the <code>y</code> is initialized and has a value in all possible cases.</p>
<p>Thankfully, if we know that all possible paths through the program will initialize <code>y</code> with a value, we can avoid declaring outside of the block entirely, as in this example.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">15</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span> 
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(y)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This example will run without any problems, since the variable <code>y</code> is defined in both blocks of the <strong>If-Then-Else</strong> statement. In short, there is no possible execution path that does not initialize <code>y</code>, so it cannot cause an error.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-inside-a-code-block">Accessing Inside a Code Block</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen several examples of this already, but here&rsquo;s a clear example of accessing a variable from a code block within the block where the variable was initialized:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> x
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(x)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, the variable <code>x</code> is initialized first, and given the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ -1 $</span>. Then, it is accessed inside of the body of the <strong>If</strong> statement. Since it was already initialized, the program can access that variable at any point in the code. Later in this chapter we&rsquo;ll see examples of chaining and nesting conditional constructs, which will give us more examples of how this works.</p>

<h1>Chaining &amp; Nesting</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F29jX1H-iUY">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>

<a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/04-conditionals/07-python/04-chaining-nesting/video/">Video Materials</a></p>
<p>One of the most powerful features of the conditional constructs we&rsquo;ve covered so far in this course is the ability to chain them together or nest them within each other to achieve remarkably useful program structures. The ability to use conditional constructs effectively is one of the most powerful skills to develop as a programmer.</p>
<h2 id="zero-one-negative-one">Zero, One, Negative One</h2>
<p>A great example of the many ways to structure a program using conditional constructs is building a simple program that does three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>If <code>x</code> is less than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, output <code>-1</code></li>
<li>If <code>x</code> is equal to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, output <code>0</code></li>
<li>If <code>x</code> is greater than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, output <code>1</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at two different ways we could structure this program using the conditional constructs we&rsquo;ve already learned.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle tip">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Try It!</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>See if you can build each of these examples in <code>Conditionals.py</code> file, which is open in to the left. Doing so is a great way to get additional practice working with conditional constructs.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="chaining-if-then-statements">Chaining If-Then Statements</h2>
<p>First, we could chain together several <strong>If</strong> statements to create this program. As a flowchart, the program might look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.7.x.3.chaining.png" alt="Chaining If-Then Statements"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one way that program could be written in Python. Once again, we&rsquo;re just using hard-coded variables for now:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#f92672">-</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Just like we see in the flowchart, this program contains three <strong>If</strong> statements chained together, one after another. If we run this program with various inputs, we should see that it produces the expected result.</p>
<h2 id="nesting-if-then-else-statements">Nesting If-Then-Else Statements</h2>
<p>Next, we can achieve the same result using <strong>IF-Else</strong> statements. Here&rsquo;s what that program would look like as as flowchart:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.7.x.3.nesting.png" alt="Nesting If-Then-Else Statements"></p>
<p>We can also write that program in Python. Here&rsquo;s one possible way to do it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#f92672">-</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        print(<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        print(<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we&rsquo;ve nested an <strong>If-Else</strong> statement inside of the second block of another <strong>If-Else</strong> statement. So, if the first Boolean expression, <code>x &lt; 0</code>, is <code>True</code>, we&rsquo;ll output <code>-1</code> and end the program. However, if it is <code>False</code>, we&rsquo;ll go into the <code>False</code> branch of the first statement. Then, we&rsquo;ll see another Boolean expression, <code>x == 0</code>. If that expression is <code>True</code>, we&rsquo;ll output <code>0</code>. Otherwise, we&rsquo;ll output <code>1</code>. Once again, this program should produce the correct result.</p>
<p>Of course, we could include a third <strong>If-Else</strong> statement, as shown in this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#f92672">-</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        print(<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>            print(<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>            print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;ERROR!&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we discussed earlier in this chapter, we can safely infer that <code>x</code> must be greater than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span> based on the two previous Boolean expressions. However, what if we&rsquo;ve made a logic error in our program, and that assumption is not valid? By including the last <strong>If-Else</strong> statement, we can have our program print an error in the unlikely chance that the value of <code>x</code> is not properly handled by any other option.</p>
<p>In fact, here&rsquo;s how easy it is to cause just that sort of logic error. Consider the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#f92672">-</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        print(<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>            print(<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>            print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;ERROR!&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div>
  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle tip">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Spot The Error</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Can you spot the logic error in the example above? Try running the code with different values for <code>x</code> and see what happens.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>In this example, we&rsquo;ve updated the Boolean expression in the first <strong>If-Else</strong> statement to <code>x &lt; -1</code>. Similarly, we&rsquo;ve changed the Boolean expression in the third statement to <code>x &gt; 1</code>. That change seems logical, right?</p>
<p>What if the value of <code>x</code> is exactly 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> or 
<span class="math align-center">$ -1 $</span>? In that case, it will fail all three logic expressions, and the program will output <code>ERROR!</code> instead. By including the third <strong>If-Else</strong> statement, we can detect logic errors that may not easily be found otherwise. Without that statement, the program would most likely output <code>1</code> even when the input is <code>-1</code>, which is clearly a negative number.</p>
<p>So, in many cases, it may be better to include additional <strong>If-Else</strong> statements to explicitly check all possible cases, instead of relying on assumptions and inferences, which may lead to unintended logic errors.</p>
<h2 id="inline-nesting">Inline Nesting</h2>
<p>Finally, it is desirable to minimize nested <strong>If-Else</strong> statements if the nested statement is exclusively in the <code>false</code> branch. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<p>Many programming languages refer to this structure as an <strong>If-Else If-Else</strong> statement. In this program, if the first Boolean expression is <code>False</code>, it immediately moves to the next Boolean expression following the first <code>elif</code> keyword.  The process continues until one Boolean expression evaluates to <code>True</code>, or the final <code>else</code> keyword is reached. In that case, we know that none of the Boolean expressions evaluated to <code>True</code>, so the final <code>False</code> branch is executed.</p>

<h1>If-Elif Jump Tables</h1>
<p>Many programming languages include a special type of conditional construct, called a <strong>Switch Statement</strong>. It allows the computer to select a branch directly based on the value of a variable. So, instead of building many inline <strong>If-Else If-Else</strong> statements, the code uses a single <strong>Switch Statement</strong> instead, with a number of cases that represent each possible value of the variable and the associated block of code that should be executed. <strong>Switch Statements</strong> are included in C, Java, and many other languages.</p>
<p>Python does not include a <strong>Switch Statement</strong> construct. Since Python is not a compiled language, it cannot make use of the structure of a <strong>Switch Statement</strong> to optimize the generated machine code. Instead, we should just use the inline <strong>If-Else If-Else</strong> structure found on the previous page.</p>

<h1>Ternary Statement</h1>
<p>Python also includes the <strong>Ternary Conditional Operator</strong>, which can be used as a shortcut for an <strong>If-Then-Else</strong> statement.</p>
<p>First, consider the flowchart we saw earlier in this chapter:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/04-cond/4.5.ternary.png" alt="Ternary Operator Flowchart"></p>
<p>In Python, this flowchart could be represented by the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> y <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span> y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(z)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this program, the expression <code>x if x &gt; y else y</code> is the <strong>Ternary Conditional Operator</strong>. It first calculates the value of the Boolean expression <code>x &gt; y</code>. If that expression is <code>True</code>, then the entire expression evaluates to <code>x</code>. If it is <code>False</code>, then the expression evaluates to <code>y</code>. So, if we run this program, it should output <code>5</code>. To best understand this operator, we can simply read aloud what it says: &ldquo;Set <code>z</code> to <code>x</code> if <code>x &gt; y</code>. If not, set <code>z</code> to <code>y</code> instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We can also include the <strong>Ternary Conditional Operator</strong> anywhere we&rsquo;d normally use a value. This is because, just like any other operator, the <strong>Ternary Conditional Operator</strong> results in a single value when evaluated. For example, it could be used directly within the <code>print()</code> method:</p>

<h1>Subgoals</h1>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve seen how to work with conditional constructs in Python, let&rsquo;s break down our thought process a bit into subgoals once again.</p>
<h2 id="evaluating-conditional-constructs">Evaluating Conditional Constructs</h2>
<p>Here are the subgoals we can use for evaluating conditional constructs:</p>
<h3 id="1-diagram-which-statements-go-together">1. Diagram Which Statements Go Together</h3>
<p>First, when we see a conditional construct in code, we must determine which statements go together. Specifically, we need to know which statements are in the <code>True</code> branch, and which statements are in the <code>False</code> branch. This may seem pretty straightforward, but if the code contains many nested statements or poor formatting, it can be very difficult to do.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">True</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">False</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;one&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;two&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we see that there are three distinct branches. First, we have the <code>True</code> branch of the outermost <strong>If-Else</strong> statement, which includes the inner <strong>If</strong> statement. That statement itself has a <code>True</code> branch that will print <code>one</code> to the terminal. The outermost statement also has a <code>False</code> branch, which will print <code>two</code> to the terminal.</p>
<h3 id="2-determine-if-boolean-expression-is-true-or-false">2. Determine if Boolean Expression is <code>True</code> or <code>False</code></h3>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve identified our conditional construct, the next step is to determine if the Boolean expression inside of the <code>if</code> statement is <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. Sometimes this step is simple, but other times it can be tricky. Thankfully, we can refer back to the subgoals we&rsquo;ve already seen for evaluating expressions if we need a bit of help.</p>
<h3 id="3-follow-the-correct-branch">3. Follow the Correct Branch</h3>
<p>After we find the value of the Boolean expression, we can simply follow the <code>True</code> branch if the Boolean expression evaluated to <code>True</code>. If the Boolean expression evaluated to <code>False</code>, we can follow the <code>False</code> branch if it exists. If the conditional construct is an <strong>If</strong> statement, we can simply ignore the rest of the conditional construct and move on to the next part of the program.</p>
<h2 id="writing-conditional-constructs">Writing Conditional Constructs</h2>
<p>We can also use subgoals to help us write new conditional constructs.</p>
<h3 id="1-define-how-many-mutually-exclusive-paths-are-needed">1. Define How Many Mutually Exclusive Paths are Needed</h3>
<p>First, when building a new conditional construct, we must determine how many paths are needed. In effect, this will be one more than the number of conditional constructs we&rsquo;ll end up using in most cases.</p>
<h3 id="2-order-paths-from-most-restrictiveselective-to-least-restrictive">2. Order Paths from Most Restrictive/Selective to Least Restrictive</h3>
<p>Next, we can reorder the paths from most restrictive to least restrictive. The most restrictive path would be the one that is least likely to occur, while the least restrictive path is the one that will be taken most often. We&rsquo;ll see how this works a bit more clearly in the example on the next page.</p>
<h3 id="3-write-if-statement-with-boolean-expression">3. Write <code>if</code> Statement with Boolean Expression</h3>
<p>Once we have all of our paths identified and ordered, we can start writing our <code>if</code> statements for each path. Each <code>if</code> statement will need a Boolean expression to help us determine which branch to follow. Generally, we&rsquo;ll place the most restrictive paths inside of the less restrictive paths, but it all depends on the problem and what order makes the most sense.</p>
<h3 id="4-write-true-branch-code">4. Write <code>True</code> Branch Code</h3>
<p>Then, for each conditional construct, we must fill in the code on the inside of the <code>True</code> branch. This could be a block of code, or even another conditional construct.</p>
<h3 id="5-write-false-branch-code">5. Write <code>False</code> Branch Code</h3>
<p>Similarly, we must fill in the code on the inside of the <code>False</code> branch, if needed. This could be a block of code, or even another conditional construct.</p>
<h3 id="6-repeat-3-5-for-all-paths">6. Repeat 3-5 For All Paths</h3>
<p>Finally, once we&rsquo;ve created a conditional construct, we may have to repeat these steps again and again for each path that we identified in subgoal 1.</p>
<p>On the next page, we&rsquo;ll see how we can apply these subgoals in a worked example.</p>

<h1>A Worked Example</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuN4EovAWy8">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>

<a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/04-conditionals/07-python/08-worked-example/video/">Video Materials</a></p>
<!-- TODO Update Video -->
<p>We&rsquo;ve covered quite a bit of new material so far in this chapter. Let&rsquo;s work through a complete example from start to finish, just to see how we can put all of those pieces together to make a very powerful program.</p>
<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s start with a problem statement. Here&rsquo;s an interesting problem that we can try to solve:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write an object oriented program that accepts a command line argument that is a positive integer representing a year, and prints whether that year is a leap year or not. If the year is a leap year, it should print output similar to <code>2000 is a Leap Year</code>. If not, it should print output similar to <code>2001 is not a Leap Year</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this sounds like a simple problem, there are actually several rules we&rsquo;ll have to handle. According to the United States Naval Observatory, the Gregorian calendar (the calendar in use throughout much of the world) calculates whether a year is a leap year based on the following rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is. - 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#cite_note-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ll be writing a program that can handle all of those rules to determine if a year is a leap year or not.</p>
<h2 id="class-set-up-and-handling-input">Class Set-up and Handling Input</h2>
<p>First, we know that our program needs to handle command line input, so we&rsquo;ll need to add the <em>import statements</em> at the top of the file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Load required modules</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> sys
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, we&rsquo;ll need to create the skeleton, or boiler plate, code associated with an object oriented program in Example.py.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Load required modules</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    Example<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>main(sys<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>argv)
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="the-main-guard">The Main Guard</h3>
<h4 id="namespace">Namespace</h4>
<p>Namespace management is one of the complex aspects of translating to machine-code the interpreter handles for you.  You do not need to know how this works, but this brief explanation is included for completeness.</p>
<p>All compilers and interpreters have a concept of &ldquo;namespace&rdquo;.  Namespace is a set of <b>unique</b> identifiers used to refer to memory locations.  These locations may contain data or instructions. The critical thing is that <b>at a particular place in a program</b> the interpreter knows <b>exactly</b> the memory location to which each identifier refers.</p>
<p>This can be a problem as good variable names are hard to come by.  The identifier <code>name</code> may be used dozens of times for different things in a large program.  To make these names unique, interpreters often prepend extra information in the namespace version of the identifier name.  <code>year</code> above might be <code>Example.Example.main.year</code> in the interpreter&rsquo;s official namespace: <code>year</code> in the file Example.py, in the class Example, in the method.main.</p>
<h4 id="__name__"><code>__name__</code></h4>
<p>The built in attribute (variable) <code>__name__</code> is part of the the Python namespace schema.  The program which is executed (run) gets the special name: <code>__main__</code> (files or modules which are imported get different <code>__name__</code>s).  So if we were to run Example.py with the command <code>python3 Example.py 1984</code>, the variable <code>year</code> is probably tracked in the namespace as <code>__main__.Example.main.year.</code>  Without regard to how many import statements or files a finished program might use, the stuff in the start-up file is always <code>__main__ ...</code>.</p>
<h4 id="if-__name__--__main__-"><code>if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot; </code></h4>
<p>So now we can see how the Main Guard works.  If and only if Example.py is executed from the command line, its <code>__name__</code> will be <code>&quot;__main__&quot;</code>.  And if it is run form the command line, we run the body or <code>Example.main(sys,argv)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-down-the-problem-statement">Breaking Down the Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Before we start writing more code, let&rsquo;s break down the problem statement a bit and see how we can use it to help us identify parts of the program we need to write.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s our problem statement again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write an object oriented program that accepts a positive integer from the command line which represents a year, and prints whether that year is a leap year or not. If the year is a leap year, it should print output similar to <code>2000 is a Leap Year</code>. If not, it should print output similar to <code>2001 is not a Leap Year</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at this problem statement, we see that we need at least one variable to store the year that is provided as input from the user. Similarly, we need at least one conditional construct, which will allow us to print whether the given year is a leap year or not. Here&rsquo;s the problem statement again, with those parts highlighted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write an object oriented program that accepts a positive integer(<strong>variable</strong>) from the command line which represents a year, and prints whether that year is a leap year or not (<strong>conditional construct</strong>). If the year is a leap year (<strong>true branch</strong>), it should print output similar to <code>2000 is a Leap Year</code>. If not (<strong>false branch</strong>), it should print output similar to <code>2001 is not a Leap Year</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, we can look at the second part of the problem statement and break it down as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is. - 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#cite_note-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at this, we see that there are actually three conditional constructs we need to build. Let&rsquo;s mark them in the statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every year that is exactly divisible by four (<strong>conditional construct 1</strong>) is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100 (<strong>conditional construct 2</strong>), but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400 (<strong>conditional construct 3</strong>). For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is. - 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#cite_note-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;ll have to be careful to make sure that each branch of these three conditional statements produces the correct output. Below, we&rsquo;ll see how we can construct code for this problem.</p>
<h2 id="reading-input">Reading Input</h2>
<p>Generally, one of the first things our program should do is read the input from the command line, and then store it in an appropriate variable type. In this case, we want to read a single integer, so we&rsquo;d add the following line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>year <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(sys[<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>])    
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, the problem statement has one very important part in it that we&rsquo;ll need to handle as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a program that accepts a <strong>positive integer</strong> that represents a year&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ll need to make sure the user has input a positive integer into our program. We can do that using a simple <strong>If-Else</strong> statement:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>year <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(args[<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>])
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> year <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Error&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#75715e"># more code here</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, we might be tempted to use an <strong>If</strong> statement instead. However, we need to make sure our program only calculates a result if the input is positive. If it is negative, we should just print an error. Since that means our program needs two distinct branches, we should use an <strong>If-Else</strong> statement here.</p>
<h2 id="calculating-output">Calculating Output</h2>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve read our input, we need to calculate our output. Let&rsquo;s handle the three rules one at a time.</p>
<h3 id="divisible-by-hahahugoshortcode-s2-hbhb">Divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span></h3>
<p>For the first rule, we must check to see if the year is divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>. We can use the modulo operator to do this. Remember that the modulo operator performs a division and returns the remainder. So, if the remainder is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, then we know that the number is evenly divisible by the divisor.</p>
<p>In code, we could do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>year <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(args[<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>])

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> year <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:

<h3 id="not-divisible-by-hahahugoshortcode-s5-hbhb">Not Divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 100 $</span></h3>
<p>Next, we need to handle the rule that any year divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 100 $</span> is not a leap year, even if it is divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>. Of course, we can easily determine mathematically that all years divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 100 $</span> are also divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>, so we don&rsquo;t have to worry about the other case in this instance. So, we can add another <strong>If-Else</strong> to our program:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, we chose to next our <strong>If-Else</strong> statement inside of the previous statement. So, if the year is divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span> and also divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 100 $</span>, we print <code>Not a Leap Year</code>. If it is divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span> and not divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 100 $</span>, which is the <code>false</code> branch of the innermost <strong>If-Else</strong>, we know that it must be a leap year, so we can print <code>Leap Year</code>.</p>
<h3 id="unless-divisible-by-hahahugoshortcode-s14-hbhb">Unless Divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 400 $</span></h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more rule we must add, which is the rule that a year divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 400 $</span> must be a leap year, even though it is also divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 100 $</span>. So, we must add one additional <strong>If-Else</strong> statement. But where?</p>
<p>If we think back through the rules, we know that this rule is only in effect when the year is both divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 100 $</span>. So, we&rsquo;ll need to add one more statement in the <code>True</code> branch of the innermost <strong>If-Else</strong>:</p>

<p>Of course, there are many other ways this program could have been structured that would produce the same output.

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we learned all about conditional constructs and how we can use them in our programs. They allow us to build programs that execute different pieces of code depending on inputs provided by the user or the values of variables.</p>
<p>This is one of the first major steps toward building larger and more complex programs. In fact, once we learn how to write programs that can repeat steps, we&rsquo;ll have covered all of the basic building blocks of programming!</p>
