      <description>Resources Slides Video Script One of the most powerful features of the conditional statements we&amp;rsquo;ve covered in this chapter is the ability to chain them together or nest them within one another to achieve more complex program structures. Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through a couple of examples to see how we can go from a program structure to the appropriate code in Python.
The program we are writing is fairly simple. Given an integer as input, our program should output -1 if it is negative, 0 if it is exactly equal to 0, or 1 if it is a positive number.</description>
