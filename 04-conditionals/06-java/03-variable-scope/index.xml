    <title>Variable Scope :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/04-conditionals/06-java/03-variable-scope/</link>
    <description>Now that we’ve learned how to create new code blocks in our programs using constructs such as the if and if-else statements, we must take a minute to discuss one of the major limitations of those code blocks.&#xA;The scope of a variable refers to the possible areas in a program’s code where that variable can be accessed and used. This is very important to understand once we begin introducing additional code blocks in our programs, because variables declared inside of a code block cannot be accessed outside of that block.</description>
