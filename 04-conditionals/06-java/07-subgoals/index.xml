    <description>Now that we’ve seen how to work with conditional constructs in Java, let’s break down our thought process a bit into subgoals once again.&#xA;Evaluating Conditional Constructs Here are the subgoals we can use for evaluating conditional constructs:&#xA;1. Diagram Which Statements Go Together First, when we see a conditional construct in code, we must determine which statements go together. Specifically, we need to know which statements are in the true branch, and which statements are in the false branch.</description>
