    <description>Problem Statement Write a program that accepts a positive integer that represents a year, and prints whether that year is a leap year or not. If the year is a leap year, it should print output similar to &#34;2000 is a Leap Year&#34;. If not, it should print output similar to &#34;2001 is not a Leap Year&#34;. Leap Years Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.</description>
