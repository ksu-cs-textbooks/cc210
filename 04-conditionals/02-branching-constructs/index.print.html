<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a second flowchart. For this program, we&rsquo;ll have the user input a number. If the number is even, we&rsquo;ll output <code>even</code>, but if it is odd, we&rsquo;ll output <code>odd</code>. Let&rsquo;s look at what this program might look like as a flowchart:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-2157861a3474a7360cfc09f355efb214" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Even Odd Program Flowchart" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/04-cond/4.2.evenodd.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-2157861a3474a7360cfc09f355efb214"><img alt="Even Odd Program Flowchart" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/04-cond/4.2.evenodd.png"></a></p>
<p>This flowchart uses a diamond-shaped block to indicate a decision we&rsquo;d like our computer program to make. Inside the block, we see the Boolean logic expression <code>x % 2 == 0</code>, which will determine whether <code>x</code> is evenly divisible by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span>. If so, the result of the modulo operation would be 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, so the entire statement would evaluate to <code>true</code>, indicating that <code>x</code> is an even number.</p>
<p>We also see two arrows coming from this block, one on the left if the statement is <code>false</code>, and another, on the right, if the statement is <code>true</code>. Each path leads to a different output, before being joined together at the end.</p>
<p>Nearly every programming language supports a method for running different parts of code based on the result of some Boolean logic expression, just like in this example. Collectively, these methods are known as <em>conditional constructs</em>, sometimes referred to as <em>conditional statements</em> or just <em>conditionals</em>. In the example above, the diamond-shaped block represents a <em>conditional construct</em> in that program.</p>
<h2 id="complex-decisions">Complex Decisions</h2>

<p><a href="/cc210/04-conditionals/02-branching-constructs/video/">Video Materials</a></p>
<p>Of course, we can make even more complicated decisions in our programs. Let&rsquo;s take a look at one more flowchart and see if we can understand what this program does:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-b3d826013e05305e51905c31df40d6ba" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Big Flowchart" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/04-cond/4.2.big.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-b3d826013e05305e51905c31df40d6ba"><img alt="Big Flowchart" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/04-cond/4.2.big.png"></a></p>
<p>At first glance, this flowchart may seem quite confusing. However, by looking closely at the decisions it makes and the corresponding output, we should realize that it is a program that plays the common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors" rel="external" target="_blank">&ldquo;Rock, Paper, Scissors&rdquo;</a> game.</p>
<p>First, the program accepts two inputs, representing the symbols chosen by each player, and stores them in variables <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>. Then, it checks to see if the inputs are equal. If so, the program declares the game to be a tie by outputting <code>tie</code>, and then it ends. If the inputs are not equal, then it can determine a winner.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to describe how the rest of the program works, let&rsquo;s look at a few possible inputs and trace the program&rsquo;s execution through the flowchart, just to see what it does.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at the case when player 1 chooses &ldquo;rock&rdquo; and player 2 chooses &ldquo;paper&rdquo;. So, our variables would be <code>p1 = &quot;rock&quot;</code> and <code>p2 = &quot;paper&quot;</code>. Here&rsquo;s a trace of the path that input would follow through the flowchart:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-5db829f28c7ad6394c600db3a8ecd628" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Rock Paper Flowchart" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/04-cond/4.2.bigrockpaper.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-5db829f28c7ad6394c600db3a8ecd628"><img alt="Rock Paper Flowchart" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/04-cond/4.2.bigrockpaper.png"></a></p>
<p>As we can see, first the program will check to see if the inputs are equal. Since they are not, it will follow the <code>false</code> branch to the left. Then, it will determine if player 1&rsquo;s input was <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code>. Since that is the case, it will follow the <code>true</code> branch to the right. After that, the program will test if <code>p2 == &quot;paper&quot;</code>, which is also true. So, the program will follow the right branch, and output <code>p2 wins</code>. We can see that this output is indeed correct, since the rules of the game states that &ldquo;paper covers rock&rdquo;, meaning that player 2&rsquo;s choice of paper will beat player 1&rsquo;s choice of rock.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at one other example. This time, player 1 chooses &ldquo;scissors&rdquo; and player 2 chooses &ldquo;paper&rdquo;. Here&rsquo;s a flowchart representing our program with those inputs:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-a9b5f8003c7614c25c3913ae2d7b6aad" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Scissors Paper Flowchart" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/04-cond/4.2.bigscissorspaper.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-a9b5f8003c7614c25c3913ae2d7b6aad"><img alt="Scissors Paper Flowchart" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/04-cond/4.2.bigscissorspaper.png"></a></p>
<p>In this example, the program will first decide if the inputs are equal. They are not, so the program will once again follow the <code>false</code> branch to the left. Then, it will test to see if player 1&rsquo;s input was <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code>. In this case, the user input <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code>, so this test is false, and the program will choose the <code>false</code> branch to the left.</p>
<p>Next, it will try to determine if player 1&rsquo;s input was <code>&quot;paper&quot;</code>. Since that is also not the case, it will follow the <code>false</code> branch to the left once again.</p>
<p>At this point, our program knows that player 1 did not input either <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;paper&quot;</code>, so it can assume that the input must be <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code>. So, it will then check to see if player 2&rsquo;s input was <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code>. This is also false, so it will choose the <code>false</code> branch once again.</p>
<p>From earlier, it knows that player 2&rsquo;s input is different from player 1, and player 2 did not input <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code>. Since player 1&rsquo;s input is assumed to be <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code>, that means that player 2 must have chosen <code>&quot;paper&quot;</code> as it is the only valid input left.</p>
<p>Therefore, this program has determined that player 1&rsquo;s input was <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code> and player 2&rsquo;s input was <code>&quot;paper&quot;</code>. By the rules of the game, &ldquo;scissors cuts paper&rdquo;, so player 1 wins. Our program will correctly output <code>p1 wins</code>!</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Making Assumptions &amp; Inferences</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>In the examples above we made a very important assumption, which allowed us to infer information about each user&rsquo;s input. Can you find a possible problem with the programs as shown in the diagrams above?</p>
<p>In those examples, we assumed that the users would only input either <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;paper&quot;</code>, or <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code>. Based on that assumption, if we have determined that a player&rsquo;s input was neither <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code> nor <code>&quot;paper&quot;</code>, as we did in the last example, then we can infer that the user must have chosen <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>However, we did not <em>specify</em> how that assumption was enforced in our diagram. In a real-world program, how to handle bad input is often specified, which can lead to additional decision boxes in the flowchart that would test each user&rsquo;s input against a list of valid inputs before accepting it. This would make the flowchart significantly larger and more complex, which is why they were omitted for this example.</p>
<p>As you complete the programming examples and projects in this course, you&rsquo;ll need to pay special attention to the program&rsquo;s specifications and any assumptions made about possible user inputs. It will often be the case that there is <strong>no</strong> instructions given for handling bad input.  In this case, our program should do nothing since it wasn&rsquo;t specified.  Adding unspecified features is a bad programming practice, so we want to avoid adding any instructions that are not explicitly listed in the program specification. In a formal development process, a &ldquo;bug&rdquo; would be opened to fix the specification first, and then we would update the code to match the new specification.</p>
<p>In most cases, it is always better to specify how a program handles invalid input instead of relying on assumptions about what your users may or may not provide as input.</p>
<p><em>The customer may always be right, but users should never be trusted to follow instructions!</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As we can see, the ability to make decisions in a computer program is one of the most important building blocks we need to build more elaborate and complex programs. In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll learn about all of the different ways we can write computer programs to make decisions and perform different actions based on those decisions using conditional constructs.</p>
