    <description>With the introduction of conditional statements, our programs are starting to become more complex. Each time we run the program, it will produce different output based on the input, and some inputs may cause the program to execute different pieces of code entirely. So, we need to develop some more sophisticated testing strategies to help us debug our programs.&#xA;Every program should be thoroughly tested. By creating a large number of different test inputs, with each one testing a different part of the program, we can ensure that every line of code is executed at least once when all of our test inputs are used.</description>
