Now that you've seen a few pages in Codio, let's take a minute to discuss some of the features of the Codio user interface. Of course, Codio has some [amazing documentation](https://docs.codio.com/student), so feel free to check that out as you work with Codio.

First, let's look at the menu items at the top of the page. There are several available to you that are worth mentioning. For starters, you can click the **Codio Icon** at any time to go directly to your Codio dashboard.

Under the **Codio** menu, you can also find options to manage your preferences. Here you can adjust things such as the editor settings and theme. Feel free to adjust the settings to match your personal preferences. 

The **Project** menu allows you to work with the currently loaded Codio project. Generally you won't need to access many of these items unless your project stops working. However, they are provided for your use in case you need them.

The **File** menu contains options for manipulating the file tree, such as creating new files, renaming them, saving them, and even downloading and uploading files. As you work on larger projects, you'll be using many of these options to manage the files within your project.

Next, the **Edit** menu gives you access to the _Undo_ and _Redo_ action. 

The **Find** menu contains entries for searching documents and performing a find-and-replace operation. Most of those actions should be pretty self-explanatory.

The **View** menu allows you to customize your view in Codio. Here we'll find options for managing panels, open tabs, editor settings, and more. Feel free to make use of these options to arrange your Codio view as you prefer. Also, at the bottom of this menu is a _Play Guide_ option, which is very helpful if you accidentally close the guide and need to reopen it. 

Under the **Tools** menu, you'll find an option for accessing the _Terminal_ in your project. The Terminal gives you console access to the box that your project is running on.As you work through the content in this program, we'll slowly introduce the Terminal and some of the tasks it can perform. 

The **Education** menu is very important, though it only has a single entry. The _Mark as Completed_ option allows you to indicate that you have completed this Codio project or tutorial. Once you select that option, your work will automatically be graded and your grade will be sent to Canvas. From there, you can access the next project or module in the course.

# Don't Submit Projects Accidentally!

Be very careful when completing a project! Once you've marked a project as completed, it will become read-only, and you won't be able to make any additional changes to the project. So, you'll need to make sure you've finished everything in the project first. If you accidentally mark a project as completed, you may contact the instructors for help. Depending on the situation, they may be able to unlock it for you so you can continue your work. However, unlocking a completed project is entirely at the discretion of the instructor.

Finally, the **Help** menu gives you access to many of the support features in Codio. If you get stuck, you may want to review some of the help options available here. Of course, you can always post a message in the course help forum or email for assistance!  This is for help with Codio, not for help on the lesson content.  In general your first request for help should be through the CC210-Help email.

There are also a few other items in the interface you should be aware of. First, in the **File Tree**, there is a _Play_ icon that can also be used to open the guide for the current project. 

In the guide, there are a couple of options available by clicking the gear icon in the upper-right of the page. First, there is an option to _Restore Current Files_. This option will restore the contents of any currently open files back to the default contents from when you first opened the project. In addition, this menu also contains another way to mark the current project as completed. 

That covers most of the major features of the Codio interface that we'll be using in this course. If you have any questions about how to use Codio, feel free to ask your teahers or email for assistance.
