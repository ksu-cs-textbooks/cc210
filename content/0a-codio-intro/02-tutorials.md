Each module in Canvas will usually contain two Codio tutorial assignments. Some weeks may have more; in any event module content must be accomplished in order.

* The first tutorial is a programming language agnostic discussion of the concept the module introduces.  Often this tutorial introduces pseudo code, has questions and may contain a Parsons Puzzle. Most of the questions only allow one attempt, however Parsons Puzzles will allow multiple tries.
* The second tutorial will contain your language specific implementation of this concept; the syntax (format) and semantics (behavior/meaning) of the specific keywords.  This tutorial may include a programming example as well as a programming exercise.

In these Codio tutorials, there will be several pages of content introducing the material for that module. Some of the pages will look just like this one, with text, images, and maybe even a short video to help you learn the material.

If you'd like to see an outline of the pages available as part of this module, click the "hamburger" menu button at the top-right of the page.

Some of the pages may also include short questions to check for understanding of the material. You'll need to answer these questions as they appear in order to get points for completing the tutorial module. Remember that the tutorials make up part of your grade in this course, so make sure you answer all of the questions in the tutorial module before submitting it. In some cases, you'll be able to resubmit your answers until you get a correct answer, but other questions will not allow that.  

In fact, below is a quick example of what one of those questions would be like. Take a moment to answer the question correctly, then continue to the next page of this module.  For those of you unfamiliar with the work of Douglas Adams, the answer is forty-two.
