In this module, we explored the Model-View-Controller, or MVC, Architecture. It is a commonly used architecture for computer programs written in a variety of languages. 

The power of MVC comes from allowing us to define our model representing our data, and our view or GUI that the user interacts with, completely separately. We can then join them together in our controller, building powerful applications. 

In addition, since both the view and model are developed separately, they can be reused in several different applications.

MVC Architecture is not just used for desktop applications. Most server-side web applications are also written using MVC architecture. This helps separate the database (model) from the webpages (view), while the router (controller) interprets requests and provides responses. 

We'll get another chance to explore MVC Architecture in the project for this module.
