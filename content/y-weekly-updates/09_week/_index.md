#### General Notes

Key Points:
- The Check-It buttons do not test full code coverage
    - They will tell you if something is wrong, but not what is wrong
- Take the time to decompose the project description
    - Create an outline that makes sense to you
- Ask questions!
- You can ask for personal feedback on your code
- My office hours are Monday 10-12 and Friday 11-1
    - Use my Calendly to schedule a virtual meeting
- CC Help Sessions Wednesday 3:30-4:45 in Calvin 306
- Use the CC210 help email for course help
