The Java programming language supports Boolean values as a primitive data type named `boolean`. It also includes Boolean keywords `true` and `false` to represent each possible value. Notice that these keywords are not capitalized, unlike some other programming languages.

To declare a Boolean variable in Java, we can use the same basic syntax that we used for other variable types:

```java
boolean b;
```

We can then assign a value of `true` or `false` to that variable:

```java
boolean b;
b = true;
```

We can also combine the two statements into a single statement:

```java
boolean b = false;
```

In `Bool.java`, create a program that contains two Boolean variables, one storing the value `true` and the other storing `false`. What happens when you print those variables using `System.out.println()`? 

Remember to set up your `public class` and `public static void main(String[] args)` method.
