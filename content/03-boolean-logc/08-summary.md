In this chapter, we learned all about Boolean logic, the corresponding rules for Boolean algebra, and how we can use those concepts to create our own Boolean logic expressions that we can use in our computer programs.

In the next chapters, we'll see how we can use these expressions to control how our programs operate with programming constructs  that allow our code to select between different branches or even repeat instructions as needed.
