The Python programming language supports Boolean values as a primitive data type named `bool`. It also includes Boolean keywords `True` and `False` to represent each possible value. Notice that these keywords are capitalized, unlike in some other programming languages.

To declare a Boolean variable in Python, we can use the same basic syntax that we used for other variable types:

```Python
b = True
c = False
```

In `Bool.py`, create a program that contains two Boolean variables, one storing the value `True` and the other storing `False`. What happens when you print those variables using `print()`?
