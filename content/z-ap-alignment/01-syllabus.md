## CR 1 - Resources

_Students and teachers have access to a college-level computer science textbook in print or electronic format._

The primary teaching resource in this course is _Fundamental Computer Programming Concepts_, an eTextbook authored by K-State faculty. The textbook consists of lecture material and videos developed and presented by K-State faculty, as well as an annotated bibliography of additional readings and videos from across the internet on each topic. The textbook is used in a college-level course taught at K-State:

* CC 210 - Fundamental Computer Programming Concepts

The textbook can be found online at:

* Primary Link: https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/
* Alternate Link: https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/ 
* Authors & Contributors: https://core.cs.ksu.edu/authors/

Students will be directed to additional online resources such as official language documentation and tutorials.
