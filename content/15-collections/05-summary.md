In this module, we explored some of the useful features included in our chosen programming language. These features give us a small taste of all the handy and exciting things we can do in our programs.

In addition, we saw a method for effectively documenting our code. Even if it isn't required, it is still a very good habit to get into. 

This module is really intended to be a great capstone for this course. At this point, we have learned most of the basics of what we can do in our chosen programming language. From here, it is all about exploring different data structures, algorithms, and libraries we can use in our code.

In addition, we can learn about the frameworks and design patterns used in state-of-the-art software today, as well as the methods used by software engineers to develop software solutions to real-world problems. 

Let's all go out and try to build some cool software!
