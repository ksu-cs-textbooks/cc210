The Python Standard Library, as well as the Python programming language itself, contains several different classes specifically designed to store data. All together, they are generically referred to as **collections** since they are used to store a "collection" of data.

Python contains implementations for several different **data structures**, which are classes used to store and manipulate data in specific ways. We'll learn more about how each of these implementations works and differs in a later course, but in this course, we'll quickly describe a few of the most common ones. Specifically, we'll discuss these three data structures:

* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Tuples

Properly, Python refers to these types of items as "containers", not collections. Containers are all instances of the `collections.Container` interface.  The `collections` module contains several additional containers.
