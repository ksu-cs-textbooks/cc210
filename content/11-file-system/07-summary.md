Working with files is a very important feature of most computer programs. It can be tedious to manually enter data into a program, and likewise it is very helpful to be able to save the output for use later.

There are many more advanced things that we can do with files. For example, in a later module we’ll see how to build our own objects in code, and then save those objects to a file so we can use them again later.

In general, if your language supports either a “try-with-resources” or a “with” construct you should use it. We deliberately skipped it in the early chapter because the syntax and explanation can be daunting.
For now, we can use the power of text files to provide input and output for our programs.
