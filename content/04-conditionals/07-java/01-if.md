Now that we've covered many different types of conditional constructs, let's dive right in and see how they can be used in Java.

First, let's look at the **If** statement. In Java, the syntax for an **If** statement is shown below:

```java
if(<Boolean expression>){
  <true block>
}
```

As expected, Java will first evaluate the `<Boolean expression>` to a single Boolean value. If that value is `true`, it will execute the instructions in the `<true block>`, which can be one or more lines of code, or even additional constructs as we'll see later. If that value is `false`, then the program will simply skip over the `<true block>` and continue executing the code immediately below the **If** statement. 

It is very important to remember that the Boolean expression is enclosed by parentheses `( )`, while the block of code that should be executed if that expression is `true` is enclosed by curly braces `{ }`, just like a class body or method body. 

Let's take a look at a few code examples, just to see how this construct works in practice. First, let's consider the program represented by this flowchart from earlier in the chapter:

![If-Then Flowchart](/images/04-cond/4.3.ifthen.png)

This flowchart corresponds to the following code in Java. In this case, we'll assume `x` is hard-coded for now:

```java
int x = 1;
if(x > 0){
  System.out.println(x);
}
System.out.println("Goodbye");
```

As we can see, this program uses `x > 0` as the Boolean expression inside of the **If** statement. If it is `true`, then it will output the value of `x`. So, it is very simple to write code that matches the execution paths shown in a flowchart representing the program.

Here's one more example. Let's assume we'd like to write a program that will calculate both the sum and product of two variables, `x` and `y`, but only if they are both greater than 0. That program may look like this:

```java
int x = 5;
int y = 7;
if((x > 0) && (y > 0)){
  int sum = x + y;
  int product = x * y;
  System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
  System.out.println("Product: " + product);
}
```

As we can see, we can create more complex Boolean statements using the various Boolean operators we've already learned. In addition, we can include multiple lines of code inside the curly braces.
