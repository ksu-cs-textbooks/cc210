Now that we've covered many different types of conditional constructs, let's dive right in and see how they can be used in Python.

First, let's look at the **If** statement. In Python, the syntax for an **If** statement is shown below:

```python
if <Boolean expression>:
    <True block>
```

As expected, Python will first evaluate the `<Boolean expression>` to a single Boolean value. If that value is `True`, it will execute the instructions in the `<True block>`, which can be one or more lines of code, or even additional constructs as we'll see later. If that value is `False`, then the program will simply skip over the `<True block>` and continue executing the code immediately below the **If** statement. 

It is very important to remember that the Boolean expression is followed by a colon `:`, while the block of code that should be executed if that expression is `True` is indented. We typically use at four spaces for indentation in Python, which is the default in Codio's text editor as well.

One of the trickiest parts of working with Python code is the fact that it uses indentation to determine which lines of code belong to a block. In the example above, we use four spaces in front of lines of code directly below the **If** statement to indent them in order to show that those lines should be executed only if the Boolean expression evaluates to `True`. 

Other languages, such as Java and C, use curly braces `{ }` and ignore indentation entirely. In this way, even if the spacing in the source code is inconsistent, it can still be read and understood by a compiler.

In Python, however, we must be extremely consistent about indentation, especially as our programs become larger and more complex. It is very easy to cause issues in a program if we accidentally lose track of which level of indentation our code should be using. Because of this, there are a few rules that we should follow as we write code in Python

1. Use a consistent number of spaces for each level of indentation, usually 4 spaces for each level.
1. **NEVER** use the tab character for indentation.

Thankfully, most text editors, including the one built in to Codio, automatically convert any tab characters to spaces for us. So, when we press the **Tab** key on our keyboard, we are really adding 2 spaces to our file. In that way, we can continue to use that key to indent our code!

Let's take a look at a few code examples, just to see how this construct works in practice. First, let's consider the program represented by this flowchart from earlier in the chapter:

![If-Then Flowchart](/images/04-cond/4.3.ifthen.png)

This flowchart corresponds to the following code in Python. In this case, we'll assume `x` is hard-coded for now:

```python
x = 1
if x > 0:
    print(x)
print("Goodbye")
```

As we can see, this program uses `x > 0` as the Boolean expression inside of the **If** statement. If it is `True`, then it will output the value of `x`. Below that, we have another line of code that prints `Goodbye`, which is not indented. That line will always be executed, regardless of the value of the Boolean expression. That is because it is not a part of the `True` block that is indented inside of the **If** statement. As we can see, it is very important to pay attention to how our code is indented. 

So, it is very simple to write code that matches the execution paths shown in a flowchart representing the program.

Here's one more example. Let's assume we'd like to write a program that will calculate both the sum and product of two variables, `x` and `y`, but only if they are both greater than 0. That program may look like this:

```python
x = 5
y = 7
if (x > 0) and (y > 0):
    sum = x + y
    product = x * y
    print("Sum: " + str(sum))
    print("Product: " + str(product))
```

As we can see, we can create more complex Boolean statements using the various Boolean operators we've already learned. In addition, we can include multiple lines of code inside the **If** statement, just by indenting each line to the same level.
