Learning how to write programs that properly catch and handle exceptions is a part of becoming a good programmer. If we can build programs that can handle many common errors, our programs will be much easier to use and wonâ€™t crash nearly as often.

In this chapter, we learned about the methods for dealing with exceptions in our programs. In addition, we saw several examples of common exceptions that we may encounter. Of course, we can always refer to the online documentation for our programming language to learn even more about exceptions and how to handle them.
