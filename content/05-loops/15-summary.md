<!-- TODO Add to Codio -->

In this chapter, we learned how to modify the control flow of our programs by repeating code. This allows us to build programs that can easily repeat steps and perform many complex calculations. In a later lab, we'll learn how to use these loops to work with large amounts of data stored in lists or arrays.
