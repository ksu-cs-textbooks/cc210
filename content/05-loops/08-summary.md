Loops are one of the most important building blocks in computer programming. We can use both loops and conditional constructs to control the flow of execution in our programs, allowing us to develop very advanced pieces of software from these simple parts.

Going forward, we'll cover information about a few other important data types for dealing with larger amounts of data, as well as how we can build our programs to detect and deal with errors more gracefully.
