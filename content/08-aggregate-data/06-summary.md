As we've learned in this chapter, aggregate data types, like arrays and lists,  are a ways to store data in a program. Arrays or lists allow us to store a large amount of information in a single variable, using _indexes_ and _multiple dimensions_ to arrange the data in a logical fashion.

We can then combine those arrays with _loops_ to create powerful programs that can access all of the data stored in arrays. 

Finally, there are many different built-in operations each programming language allows us to perform on arrays and lists, such as finding their size, copying elements, and more. 

Next, we'll see how to put these concepts into practice by building a fun game in the project for this module!
