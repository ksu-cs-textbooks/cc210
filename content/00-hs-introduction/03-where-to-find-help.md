#### Video Script

As you work on the materials in this course, you may run into questions or problems and need assistance. This video reviews the various types of help available to you in this course.

First and foremost, anytime you have a questions or need assistance in this course, your first stop should be to contact your teacher. They will know your situation the best, and will be able to help you out and answer many questions you have. If they aren't sure or need assistance, they'll be able to reach out to me and other faculty at K-State. We're here to help, but we'd like you to talk to your teachers whenever you need assistance.

Beyond Piazza, there are a few resources you should be aware of. First, if you have any issues working with K-State Canvas, K-State IT resources, or any other technology related to the delivery of the course, again, please contact your teacher, who will then be able to contact us. Beyond them, there are many online resources for using Canvas, all of which are linked in the resources section below the video.

Similarly, if you have any issues using the Codio platform, once again you should contact your teacher, but you are welcome to refer to their online documentation. Their support staff offers a quick and easy chat interface where you can ask questions and get feedback within a few minutes.

If you have issues with the technical content of the course, specifically related to completing the tutorials and projects, there are several resources available to you. First and foremost, make sure you consult the vast amount of material available in the course modules, including the links to resources. Usually, most answers you need can be found there. If you are still stuck or unsure of where to go, the next best thing is to contact your teacher directly, since they can assist you with most of the course content. Of course, as another step you can always exercise your information-gathering skills and use online search tools such as Google to answer your question. While you are not allowed to search online for direct solutions to assignments or projects, you are more than welcome to use Google to access programming resources such as StackOverflow, language documentation, and other tutorials. I can definitely assure you that programmers working in industry are often using Google and other online resources to solve problems, so there is no reason why you shouldn't start building that skill now.

Next, we have grading and administrative issues. This could include problems or mistakes in the grade you received on a project, missing course resources, or any concerns you have regarding the course and the conduct of myself and your peers. Since this is an online course, you'll be interacting with us on a variety of online platforms, and sometimes things happen that are inappropriate or offensive. There are lots of resources at K-State and your school to help you with those situations. First and foremost, please contact your teacher directly, or you may also email me directly as well. If not, or if you'd rather talk with someone other than us about your issue, I encourage you to contact either your school counselor or academic advisor, the K-State CS department staff, College of Engineering Student Services, or the K-State Office of Student Life. Finally, if you have any concerns that you feel should be reported to K-State, you can do so at [https://www.k-state.edu/report/](https://www.k-state.edu/report/). That site also has links to a large number of resources at K-State that you can use when you need help.

Finally, if you find any errors or omissions in the course content, or have suggestions for additional resources to include in the course, let your teacher know. There are some extra credit points available for helping to improve the course, so be on the lookout for anything that you feel could be changed or improved.

So, in summary, contacting your teacher should always be your first step when you face an unexpected issue in the course. For issues with Canvas or Codio, you are also welcome to refer directly to the resources for those platforms. For questions specifically related to the projects, review the content in the course or ask your teacher for help. For grading questions and errors in the course content or any other issues, please contact your teacher for assistance!

Our goal in this program is to make sure that you have the resources available to you to be successful. Please don't be afraid to take advantage of them and ask questions whenever you want.
