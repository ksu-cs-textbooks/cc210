In this module, we explored how to break up our programs into smaller parts, called **methods**. We learned how to provide data to the methods using **arguments** that are stored in **parameters**, which are simply variables inside of the method. Then, we saw how we can **return** a value from a method, allowing us to use it to compute or construct a new value based on the arguments provided as input.

Using methods to break our programs into smaller, easily testable pieces will allow us to easily manage the level of complexity that comes with building ever larger computer programs.
