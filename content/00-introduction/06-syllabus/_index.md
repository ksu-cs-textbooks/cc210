#### Preferred Methods of Communication:

* **Email**: Please use "cc210-help" (cc210-help@ksuemailprod.onmicrosoft.com if not on web-mail) for all communication regarding these courses as it allows instructors and TAs to provide a clear and detailed response, as well as easily store and record communication for reference later. You should receive a response within one business day, and hopefully much sooner. Note emailing the instructor or teaching assistants directly may result in longer wait times for your support.

### Prerequisites

* C or better in CC 110 - Introduction to Computing (Prerequisite or Concurrent Enrollment with instructor
permission) 

### Course Overview

Basic concepts in developing computer programs: program structure and syntax, primitive data types,
variables, control flow, iteration, simple algorithms, debugging, and good software development
practices. Introduction to object-oriented programming. 

### Course Description

The course introduces students to computer programming using one of several programming languages. Interactive lessons and engaging projects reinforce new skills and concepts while relating programming fundamentals to the real world. This course covers the basic concepts of programming, from variables and control flow to functions, objects, and simple algorithms.  

### Learning Objectives

In either Java or Python (J or P), successful students should be able to:
1. Evaluate data requirements to create variables, use operators and call/create functions for: strings, integers, real numbers and Boolean values.
2. Understand the creation and use of mono-typed Lists (P) or Arrays (J) and their common built in methods and attributes.
3. Analyze and adapt string methods to split, join and extract sub-strings to solve problems.
4. Understand how code written by them may throw exceptions
    1. Understand how to create new exceptions
    1. Understand and adapt exception handling structures
5. Understand how to create programs that read-from and write-to text files.
6. Analyze and create conditional statement to control program execution
7. Analyze and create loops to control program execution
8. Analyze and adapt methods/function to control program execution
    1. Remember to consider separation of concerns when creating methods
9. Understand how to create instance-based classes to include 
    1. public/private access of components
    1. attributes, properties and methods
    1. inheritance
10. Understand how to adapt Boolean equations to common natural language problem statements 
11. Understand how to adapt class APIs to incorporate objects in solutions
12. Analyze medium-to-low-level designs expressed as text-based program requirements to create programs including: UML Class diagrams, flow charts and pseudo code 
13. Create terminal or console based programs

### Major Course Topics

* Standard Library/Module Collections and generic types 


###  Course Structure
This course is intended to be taught 100% online, each module is self-paced, and each module must be
completed to progress to the next one. Students are expected to make good progress; we have found
students who fall behind often fail to successfully complete the class.
In general, one or more modules are assigned each week. There are 3 weeks where no new module is
assigned. This is a strong indication that the previous week’s module takes a lot of time (modules 7, 10
and 12).
Modules will contain recorded videos, online tutorials, text and links to online resources. Each module
will include a coding project or assignment, many of which will be graded automatically through Codio.
You will be asked to pick a language by the end of the first week (Java or Python) at which point you will
be invited to a language specific Canvas course. All content is accessed through this second Canvas
course. 

### Grading

Each student starts with 0 points in the gradebook and works upward toward a final point total earned
out of the possible number of points. In this course, each assignment constitutes a portion of the final
grade, as detailed below:
70% - Codio Programming Projects
30% - Codio Tutorials and Canvas Quizzes 


Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale:

* 90% - 100% &rarr; A
* 80% - 89.99% &rarr; B
* 70% - 79.99% &rarr; C
* 60% - 69.99% &rarr; D
* 00% - 59.99% &rarr; F

### Late Work

{{% notice warning %}}
Read this late work policy very carefully! If you are unsure how to interpret it, please contact the instructors via the help email. Not understanding the policy does not mean that it won't apply to you!
{{% /notice %}}

Since this course is entirely online, students may work at any time and at their own pace through the modules. However, to keep everyone on track, there will be approximately one module due each week. Each graded item in the module will have a specific due date specified. **Any assignment submitted late will have that assignment’s grade reduced by 10% of the total possible points on that project for each day it is late.** This penalty will be assessed automatically in the Canvas gradebook. 

Even if a module is not submitted on time, it must still be completed before a student is allowed to begin the next module. So, students should take care not to get too far behind, as it may be very difficult to catch up.

Finally, all course work must be submitted on or before the last day of the semester in which the student is enrolled in the course in order for it to be graded on time.

If you have extenuating circumstances, please discuss them with the instructor as soon as they arise so other arrangements can be made. If you find that you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to make up missed work.

### Incomplete Policy

Students should strive to complete this course in its entirety before the end of the semester in which they are enrolled. However, since retaking the course would be costly and repetitive for students, we would like to give students a chance to succeed with a little help rather than immediately fail students who are struggling.

If you are unable to complete the course in a timely manner, please contact the instructor to discuss an incomplete grade. Incomplete grades are given solely at the instructor's discretion. See the official [K-State Grading Policy](https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/students/academicpolicy/#GRADING) for more information. In general, _poor time management alone is not a sufficient reason for an incomplete grade_.

Unless otherwise noted in writing on a signed [Incomplete Agreement Form](https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/forms/Incomplete%20agreement%20form.docx), the following stipulations apply to any incomplete grades given in Computational Core courses:

1. Students may receive at most two incompletes in Computational Core courses throughout their time in the program
2. Students will be given 6 calendar weeks from the end of the enrolled semester's finals week to complete the course
3. Any modules in a future CC course which depend on incomplete work will not be accessible until the previous course is finished
  1. For example, if a student is given an incomplete in CC 210, then all modules in CC 310 will be inaccessible until CC 210 is complete
4. Students understand that access to instructor and GTA assistance may be limited after the end of an academic semester due to holidays and other obligations
5. If a student fails to resolve an incomplete grade after 6 weeks, they will be assigned an 'F' in the course. In addition, they will be dropped from any other Computational Core courses which require the failed course as a prerequisite or corequisite.

### Recommended Texts & Supplies

To participate in this course, students must have access to a modern web browser and broadband internet connection. All course materials will be provided via Canvas and Codio. Modules may also contain links to external resources for additional information, such as programming language documentation.

### Subject to Change

The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students.

{{% notice warning %}}
Effective 9/26/2022: Due to rampant plagiarism, the copying and pasting of code is no longer allowed. All coding must be done in the Codio IDE. Moving forward, if you paste any code into Codio (other than code which is explicitly given as starter code) you will receive an XF. The `X` indicates that academic dishonesty occurred and the `F` indicates that you failed the course.
