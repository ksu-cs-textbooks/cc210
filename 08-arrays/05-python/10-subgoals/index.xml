    <description>Working with lists in Python can also be quite complex. Thankfully, we can break each step down into subgoals to make it more manageable.&#xA;Evaluating Lists Here are the subgoals we can use to evaluate statements with lists:&#xA;1. Set up List from 0 to Size - 1 This may be a bit confusing at first, but it will really help us understand lists. Anytime we are tracing code and see a new list defined, we need to set up a list in our variables to store those values.</description>
