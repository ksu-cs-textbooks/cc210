    <description>The array is very popular in compiled languages as the “first choice” for simple aggregate data–the compiler can make a lot of optimizations and speed up performance of the executable code. Interpreted languages have much less opportunity for optimization, and the list is generally their first choice for aggregated data.&#xA;Compare and Contrast List and Array List have a variable length, you can change its number of elements. If you have a list of two items [1,2], you and add another item, [1,2,3] or take one away [1].</description>
