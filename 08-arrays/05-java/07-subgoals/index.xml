    <description>Working with arrays in Java can also be quite complex. Thankfully, we can break each step down into subgoals to make it more manageable.&#xA;Evaluating Arrays Here are the subgoals we can use to evaluate statements with arrays:&#xA;1. Set up Array from 0 to Size - 1 This may be a bit confusing at first, but it will really help us understand arrays. Anytime we are tracing code and see a new array defined, we need to set up an array in our list of variables to store those values.</description>
