      <description>So far, we’ve learned how to store many different types of data in variables. We can then use those variables in our programs to receive user input, store the results of calculations and so much more.&#xA;However, we have to individually declare and maintain each variable in our code. As we build larger programs, we’ll have to deal with a commensurately large amount of variables, and it can be hard to keep track of all of them.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Video Materials&#xA;In Theory Arrays are a special type of variable that can store multiple items of the same type, so ‘int’ or ‘bool(ean)’. Some programming languages, such as Java, comes with support for arrays built into the language. While other languages, such as Python, require us to adapt other aggregate data types to build arrays.&#xA;In general, we will stick with storing items of the same type in each array.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Video Materials&#xA;Of course, once we’ve created an array of data, we need some way to access its elements easily in our code. Thankfully, we can use the loop structures we’ve learned in a previous chapter to iterate across our arrays. Iteration is the term we use to describe accessing each element in the array and possibly performing some repeated action using that element.&#xA;For example, consider the flowchart below, showing a simple program that uses loops and arrays:</description>

      <title>Call by Reference vs. Value</title>

      <description>YouTube Video Video Materials&#xA;As we start creating objects, one major concept is how objects are handled differently than “primitive” data types when used as arguments; i.e. when passed to functions. Typically, there are two scenarios: call by value and call by reference. Let’s discuss them both in detail to understand how they differ and the impact that may have on our code.&#xA;Call by Value When method parameters are handled in a call by value way, that means that each time we call the method, that method gets a unique copy of the parameter.</description>

      <description>As we’ve learned in this chapter, aggregate data types, like arrays and lists, are a ways to store data in a program. Arrays or lists allow us to store a large amount of information in a single variable, using indexes and multiple dimensions to arrange the data in a logical fashion.&#xA;We can then combine those arrays with loops to create powerful programs that can access all of the data stored in arrays.</description>
