    <title>DRY: Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/06-methods/06-dry/</link>
    <description>One major mantra among programmers is Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY), and it’s a very important concept to keep in mind when writing programs that can use methods. In essence, anytime we find ourselves writing the same or similar code multiple times in our program, we may want to ask ourselves if it would be better to make that piece of code a method. That way, we only have to write it once, and if there are any problems with that code, we only have to remember to change it in one place instead of everywhere we’ve used it.</description>
