    <title>Writing Testable Code :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/06-methods/07-writing-testable-code/</link>
    <description>Another big idea related to writing methods in our code relates to testing. Specifically, how can we write methods that are easily testable?&#xA;Unit Testing We wonâ€™t go deep into the details in this course, but most programming languages support unit testing, which is the use of automated testing tools to make sure each piece of code works as intended. They are very important for two big reasons:&#xA;A properly written set of tests will help confirm that the code works as intended in the first place Tests that previously passed but fail after an update to our code may highlight an unintended side effect of the changes we made In fact, many of the automated grading tools in this course make extensive use of unit testing to confirm that our code is working properly, both within this tutorial textbook and in the standalone projects.</description>
