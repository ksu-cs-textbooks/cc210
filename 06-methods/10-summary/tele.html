    <meta name="description" content="As the programs we develop become larger and more complex, we’ll definitely rely on the ability to create methods to help make our code easier to read, debug, and maintain. methods allow us to write small, self-contained pieces of code that can be reused over and over again, or break large operations into smaller, simpler steps.
From this point forward, nearly any program we write will contain multiple methods. In fact, it is very rare to see any programs beyond just simple scripts that don’t contain at least a few methods.">

<p>As the programs we develop become larger and more complex, we’ll definitely rely on the ability to create methods to help make our code easier to read, debug, and maintain. methods allow us to write small, self-contained pieces of code that can be reused over and over again, or break large operations into smaller, simpler steps.</p>
<p>From this point forward, nearly any program we write will contain multiple methods. In fact, it is very rare to see any programs beyond just simple scripts that don’t contain at least a few methods.</p>
<p>In the next few modules, we’ll also see how to build classes that represent real-world objects, as well as how to add methods inside of those classes called methods to represent how those objects method in the real world.</p>
