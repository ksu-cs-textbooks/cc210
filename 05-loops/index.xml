      <description>At this point, we should be able to write a computer program that can accomplish many simple tasks. We’ve seen programs that determine if a number is even or odd, who wins in a game of “Rock, Paper, Scissors,” and whether a given year should be a leap year or not.&#xA;However, there’s one simple task that all of our current programming skills cannot easily handle. Let’s take a look at a version of that task and see if we can figure out how to solve it:</description>

      <description>Thankfully, there is. In addition to conditional statements, programming languages include a second important control construct: looping constructs, which allow us to solve problems like this one. A looping construct is a programming construct that allows us to repeat a piece of code as many times as we’d like. In this way, we can perform repeated actions without making our source code infinitely long. Most programming languages refer to this process as looping, which makes sense once we see how it looks in a flowchart.</description>

      <description>Video Materials&#xA;The simplest form of a loop in our computer programs is commonly known as a While loop. In essence, we continue to repeat the steps inside the loop while a particular Boolean expression evaluates to true. The program on the previous page is a great example of a While loop:&#xA;In this program, we repeat the steps inside the loop, which print the value of i and increment that value by 1, while the Boolean expression x &gt;= i evaluates to true.</description>

      <description>Video Materials&#xA;Most programming languages also support another type of looping construct, known as a For loop. A For loop usually includes an explicitly defined loop counter , a loop condition and loop counter incrementor as part of the loop definition, and is usually used to make sure that a loop only runs a set number of times. This is especially handy for instances where we need to accept exactly $ 5 $ inputs, or if the program should perform a calculation exactly $ 10 $ times.</description>

      <description>Video Materials&#xA;Once our code is inside of a loop, sometimes we might find situations where we need to either stop looping immediately, or perhaps start the loop over again. Thankfully, most programming languages include two special keywords that can be used in those situations.&#xA;Break The first of these keywords, break, is used to immediately exit a loop from within. The program will immediately jump to the first line of code below the loop and continue executing from there.</description>

      <description>Reading input from either the keyboard or a file are handled as streams. A stream is an abstract concept in computer science for data that is organized as a queue, where items that are added to the stream first are also the items that are read first. Put another way, when reading input from the keyboard, the program reads the keys in the order they are pressed. This is similar to a conveyor belt.</description>

      <description>Loops are one of the most important building blocks in computer programming. We can use both loops and conditional constructs to control the flow of execution in our programs, allowing us to develop very advanced pieces of software from these simple parts.&#xA;Going forward, we’ll cover information about a few other important data types for dealing with larger amounts of data, as well as how we can build our programs to detect and deal with errors more gracefully.</description>
