    <title>For Loops :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/05-loops/04-for-loops/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video Video Materials&#xA;Most programming languages also support another type of looping construct, known as a For loop. A For loop usually includes an explicitly defined loop counter , a loop condition and loop counter incrementor as part of the loop definition, and is usually used to make sure that a loop only runs a set number of times. This is especially handy for instances where we need to accept exactly $ 5 $ inputs, or if the program should perform a calculation exactly $ 10 $ times.</description>
