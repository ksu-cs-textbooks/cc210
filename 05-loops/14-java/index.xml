      <title>Reading from Stdin</title>

      <description>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to use conditional constructs, it might be helpful to understand a bit about how to get input from our users directly in our program. Each programming language provides several ways to receive user input, and each one comes with its own pros and cons.
We&amp;rsquo;ve already seen some examples of how to get user input via command line arguments. Let&amp;rsquo;s examine how to make the a program interactive while it runs by using stdin; we may refer to this as getting input from the keyboard or terminal.</description>

Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve learned some of the different looping constructs in Java, let&amp;rsquo;s work through a completed example to see how we can use loops to build more advanced programs.
Problem Statement For this example, we&amp;rsquo;d like to build a program that matches the following problem statement:
Write a program that will accept a series of integers from the keyboard, one per line. It will continue to accept integers from the user until the user inputs 0.</description>

      <title>While Loop</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/05-loops/14-java/02-while/</link>

      <description>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve added terminal entry to our tool set, let&amp;rsquo;s look at how we can use each of these looping constructs in Java. First, here is the general syntax for a While loop in Java:
while(&amp;lt;Loop Condition&amp;gt;){ &amp;lt;loop code block&amp;gt; } As expected, Java will first evaluate the &amp;lt;Loop Condition&amp;gt; to a single Boolean value. If that value is true, it will execute the instructions in the &amp;lt;loop code block&amp;gt;, which can be one or more lines of code, or even additional constructs.</description>

      <title>Do-While Loop</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/05-loops/14-java/03-do-while/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/05-loops/14-java/03-do-while/</guid>
      <description>Java also includes another form of a While loop, known as a Do-While loop . Here is the general syntax for a Do-While loop in Java:
do{ &amp;lt;loop code block&amp;gt; }while(&amp;lt;Loop Condition&amp;gt;); In this code, Java will first execute all of the code in the &amp;lt;loop code block&amp;gt; without evaluating any Boolean expressions. The main use of a Do-While loop is to guarantee that the code inside the loop is executed at least once.</description>

      <title>For Loop</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/05-loops/14-java/04-for/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/05-loops/14-java/04-for/</guid>
      <description>The syntax for a For loop in Java is a bit complex, and has many different parts. Here&amp;rsquo;s the general format:
for(&amp;lt;initializers&amp;gt;; &amp;lt;Loop Condition&amp;gt;; &amp;lt;updatesr&amp;gt;){ &amp;lt;loop code block&amp;gt; } Let&amp;rsquo;s break this syntax down into each individual part to understand how it works.
First, the &amp;lt;initializers&amp;gt; section is used to create and initialize any variables that we&amp;rsquo;d like to use as loop counters inside of the loop. For example, we could use int i = 0 in that section to create a single integer variable i and set its initial value to 0.</description>

      <title>Loop Control</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/05-loops/14-java/05-loop-control/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/05-loops/14-java/05-loop-control/</guid>
      <description>Java also includes both the break and continue keywords. They are pretty straightforward and easy to follow.
Break Here&amp;rsquo;s the flowchart showing a program with a break statement from earlier in this chapter:
This flowchart corresponds to the following code in Java. Once again, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume x is hard-coded for now:
int x = 8; int i = 1; while(true){ if(x % i != 0){ System.out.println(i); break; } i = i + 1; } This code shows us an example of an infinite While loop, sometimes referred to as a While-True loop.</description>

      <description>Of course, we can identify some subgoals for working with loops in Java as well. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at them and see how we can use them to help understand loops a little bit better.
Evaluating Loops Here are the subgoals for evaluating a loop in Java:
1. Identify Loop Parts The first and most important part of evaluating a loop is to identify each part of the loop structure.</description>
