    <title>Accumulator Pattern :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/05-loops/07-java/07-accumulator/</link>
    <description>One common use for loops is the accumulator pattern. An accumulator simply computes some values based on a large amount of data, such as the sum, maximum, minimum, average, or count. In programming, a pattern is simply a common structure that is used to solve a recurring problem in code. Since many programs end up needing a loop that acts an accumulator, weâ€™ve developed a common pattern that can be used in our code to solve this problem.</description>
