    <title>Reading from Stdin :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/05-loops/07-python/01-stdin/</link>
    <description>In Python, the stream object that grants access to Linux standard input is in the sys module and called stdin. Since sys.stdin is a tyoe of built in stream object, it has many different methods which you can call. The only one we will use is the readline() method.&#xA;sys.stdin.readline() causes Python to read characters from the keyboard until the ↵ (enter key) is pressed. At that point in makes a string, terminated with the ‘\n’ character and returns the string to the program.</description>
