    <title>Input Streams :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/05-loops/06-input-streams/</link>
    <description>Reading input from either the keyboard or a file are handled as streams. A stream is an abstract concept in computer science for data that is organized as a queue, where items that are added to the stream first are also the items that are read first. Put another way, when reading input from the keyboard, the program reads the keys in the order they are pressed. This is similar to a conveyor belt.</description>
