    <title>Loop Constructs :: CC 210 Textbook</title>

    <description>Thankfully, there is. In addition to conditional statements, programming languages include a second important control construct: looping constructs, which allow us to solve problems like this one. A looping construct is a programming construct that allows us to repeat a piece of code as many times as weâ€™d like. In this way, we can perform repeated actions without making our source code infinitely long. Most programming languages refer to this process as looping, which makes sense once we see how it looks in a flowchart.</description>
