<h2 id="cr-3---develop-understanding-of-big-ideas">CR 3 - Develop Understanding of Big Ideas</h2>
<p><em>The course provides opportunities to develop student understanding of the big ideas, as outlined in the AP Course and Exam Description (CED).</em></p>
<h3 id="big-idea-1---modularity-mod">Big Idea 1 - Modularity (MOD)</h3>
<p>Students will construct several programming projects that focus on modular development. Some examples of current projects focusing on modularity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Module 8 - TicTacToe Project</strong> Students develop a TicTacToe style game on an arbitrarily-sized 2D board. Students develop several methods to fill in squares on the board, check for a valid move, check for a win condition, and check for a draw. Students use an &ldquo;Instance and Driver&rdquo; structure, where the instance is the TicTacToe board itself and a driver acts as a simple controller to play the game.</li>
<li><strong>Module 9 - Pig Latin Translator</strong> Students develop a program to translate English text into Pig Latin following a simplified set of rules. Students write methods to break the input down into individual lines, then words, and create methods to handle items like punctuation and capitalization.</li>
<li><strong>Module 12 - Store</strong> Students develop an object-oriented model of a store, with classes representing an inventory, items in an inventory, a shopping cart, and more. Each class has several accessor and mutator methods, with the goal of simplifying the main controller class to a few straightforward method calls.</li>
<li><strong>Module 13 - Inheritance Calculator</strong> Students explore object-oriented inheritance by developing classes to represent real, rational, and integer numbers in a hierarchy, and then perform mathematical operations on those values. Each operation is modularized into its own method and can be overridden by subclasses.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="big-idea-2---variables-var">Big Idea 2 - Variables (VAR)</h3>
<p>Students will construct several programming projects that focus on using variables to store and retrieve data. Some examples of current projects focusing on variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Module 5 - Narcissistic Numbers</strong> Students build several small pieces of code, culminating in a program that will determine if an input value is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number" rel="external" target="_blank">narcissistic number</a>. This involves storing many intermediate values such as the number of digits in the number and performing exponentiation.</li>
<li><strong>Module 6 - Damage Calculator</strong> Students write a program to simulate a simplified attack turn in a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) similar to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Students must deal with multiple inputs including dice rolls, conditions on each player, and the various rules for determining if an attack is successful and how much damage it causes.</li>
<li><strong>Module 14 - MVC Battleship</strong> Students use the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture to build a program simulating the classic <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)" rel="external" target="_blank">Battleship</a></em> board game. Students will use 2D arrays to store and retrieve data and parse string inputs from the users.</li>
<li><strong>Module 15 - Minesweeper</strong> Students will build a simulated <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)" rel="external" target="_blank">Minesweeper</a></em> game. However, students are not allowed to store the entire board as a 2D array. Instead, they must make use of Java collections such as <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>HashMap</code> to store all the data needed to represent the game, and then construct the board virtually as needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="big-idea-3---control-con">Big Idea 3 - Control (CON)</h3>
<p>Students will construct several projects that focus on making decisions and altering control flow. Some examples of projects focusing on control flow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Module 4 - 4 Conditional Problems</strong> Students write four smaller projects that use control flow structures to answer simple questions such as whether a set of three inputs could represent the side lengths of a triangle, or how many days are in a given month.</li>
<li><strong>Module 5 - Narcissistic Numbers</strong> Students use many looping constructs to construct the parts needed to determine if an input value is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number" rel="external" target="_blank">narcissistic number</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Module 6 - Damage Calculator</strong> Students will use many control flow constructs to simulate a simplified attack turn in a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) similar to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. This includes determining the conditions for the attack, whether it is successful, and how much damage is done using a variety of inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Module 11 - File Manipulator</strong> Students use input commands and the state of files in a file system to print, concatenate, or otherwise manipulate existing files. Students much include proper control flow constructs to handle situations where inputs are invalid or files don&rsquo;t exist or can&rsquo;t be created.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="big-ideas-4---impact-of-computing-ioc">Big Ideas 4 - Impact of Computing (IOC)</h3>
<p>Students will engage in several interactive discussions in class and using online tools to discuss the impacts of programs developed in this course. In addition, they will be given the opportunity to discuss and ask questions about technology stories in the news and how technology is shaping our modern world (for example, NFTs and cryptocurrency, data breaches, AI generated content, etc.). Students will learn and discuss ways that they can stay informed and consider ways to understand the impact of programs they develop on the larger world.</p>
