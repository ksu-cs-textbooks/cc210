<p>[Slide 1]</p>
<p>Hello and welcome to the Computational Core program!</p>
<p>My name is Emily Alfs-Votipka, and I&rsquo;ll be one of the instructors for this program. My contact information is shown here, and is also listed on the syllabus.</p>
<!--
My name is Josh Weese, and I’ll be another of the instructors for this program. My contact information is shown here, and is also listed on the syllabus.
Currently, we have two graduate teaching assistants, Farrukh & BreAnn, who will also be working with us to manage these courses.-->
<p>[Slide 2]</p>
<p>There are many other instructors and TAs for this program that you may interact with or see in the tutorial videos. They all have been instrumental in the development of this program.</p>
<p>[Slide 3]</p>
<p>In this course we will primarily use a K-State email group (cc110-help or 

<a href="mailto:cc110-help@ksuemailprod.onmicrosoft.com">cc110-help@ksuemailprod.onmicrosoft.com</a>) to communicate.  Email sent to this address is forwarded to all instructors and TAs.  Our replies to you will also be shared amongst the instructors and TAs so we all have access to the assistance you have already received. We will respond to you within a business day
So a question emailed Friday night may not receive an answer before Monday.</p>
<p>If you wish to pose a discussion topic to you classmates, you should use the discussion feature in Canvas.  Please note that asking a question on a discussion forum is not the same as emailing cc110-help; we will certainly monitor the discussion channels, but not with the same speed as the &ldquo;help line&rdquo;.  Please read and adhere to the guidance on Netiquette in the syllabus for all electronic communications.</p>
<p>[Slide 4]</p>
<p>In addition to email and Canvas, we’ll be using the online learning platform Codio for most of the programming tutorials and projects in this program. We’ll also discuss how to use Codio later in this module.</p>
<p>[Slide 5]</p>
<p>The Computational Core program consists of several courses, and each course contains a number of learning modules. There are about 30 modules in this course. Each module will usually consist of some lecture material and quizzes, and there are a few modules which include a programming component. The modules themselves are gated, which means that you must complete each item in the module in order before continuing. In addition, the modules enforce prerequisite requirements from other modules.  For CC 110 you must complete them in order starting with module 0, the enroll module should be completed first, but is not a prerequisite.</p>
<p>You are welcome to work on this course at any time during the week as your schedule allows, provided that you complete each module before the listed due date. There will be roughly two modules due each week. The modules are self-contained, and nearly all of the grading in this course is completed automatically through Canvas and Codio. So, you can complete modules at any time before the due date, and once a module is complete, you may immediately start on the next one.</p>
<p>[Slide 6]</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the rest of this introductory module, you’ll see that there are a few more items to be completed before you can move on. In the next video, we&rsquo;ll discuss a bit more information about navigating through this course on Canvas and using the Codio learning environment.</p>
<p>[Slide 7]</p>
<p>One thing we highly encourage each of you to do is read the syllabus for this course in its entirety, and let us know if you have any questions. My view is that the syllabus is a contract between me as your teacher and you as a student, defining how each of us should treat each other and what we should expect from each other. We have made a few changes to the standard syllabus template for this program, and those changes are clearly highlighted. Finally, the syllabus itself is subject to change as needed as we adapt this program to meet the needs of its students, and all changes will be clearly communicated to everyone before they take effect.</p>
<p>[Slide 7]</p>
<p>One very important part of the syllabus that every student should read is the late work policy. First off, each module has a due date, and you may work on that module at any time before it is due, provided you have met the prerequisites. As discussed before, you must do all the readings and assignments in a module in listed order before moving on, so you cannot jump ahead. A module is considered completed when all items have been completed.</p>
<p>For the purposes of grading, we will use the date and time that the confirmation quiz was submitted at the end of each module to determine when the module was completed. This is due to the way that Codio handles automated grading, as it may resubmit previously graded assignments if an error in the module is corrected, making a previously completed assignment appear to be submitted late.</p>
<p>If any work is submitted after the due date, a penalty of 10% of the total points possible in that assignment will be deducted for each day it is late, up to a maximum of 3 days. After 3 days beyond the due date, you will receive a 0 on the assignment. Please refer to the full late policy in the syllabus for more information about how late work is handled in this course.</p>
<p>Finally, even if a module is late, it still must be completed before you can move on to a later module. So, it is very important to avoid getting behind in this course, as it can be very difficult to get back on track. If you ever find that you are struggling to keep up, please don&rsquo;t be afraid to contact either the instructors or GTAs for assistance. We&rsquo;d be happy to help you get caught back up quickly.</p>
<!-- 
The grading in this course is very simple. First, 50% of your final grade will depend on the grades you receive from the lecture modules and associated quizzes. Next, 10% of your grade will come from the interactive programming notes and labs in Codio. Another 30% of your grade will be determined by your work completing the programming homework assignments. Finally, the last 10% of your grade will come from your participation in a few interactive discussions throughout the semester.
--> 
<p>In this program, the standard &ldquo;90-80-70-60&rdquo; grading scale will apply, though I reserve the right to curve grades up to a higher grade level at my discretion. Therefore, you will never be required to get higher than 90% for an A, but you may get an A if you score slightly below 90% if I choose to curve the grades.</p>
<p>This is intended to be a completely online, self-paced course. There are no mandatory scheduled course times. All of the content is available online, so you can work whenever and wherever you want. It could be a 3-hour block once a week, or a few minutes here and there between classes. It’s really up to you and your schedule. However, remember that each module may require 4 to 6 or more hours of work to complete, so make sure you have plenty of time available to devote to this course.</p>
<p>Also, a vast majority of the grading in this course will be handled automatically through Canvas and Codio. This means that you&rsquo;ll be able to receive feedback directly from those systems as soon as you submit your work. You may also contact the instructors and GTAs for additional tips and feedback regarding your work, but depending on the number of students in the program, we may not be able to review every student submission directly.</p>
<p>In addition, due to the flexible online format of this class, there won&rsquo;t be any long lecture videos to watch. Instead, each module will consist of a guided tutorial and several short videos, each focused on a particular topic or task. Likewise, there won&rsquo;t be any textbooks required, since all of the information will be presented in the interactive tutorials through Codio. Finally, since we are using Codio as our learning platform, you won&rsquo;t have to deal with installing and using a clunky integrated development environment, or IDE, just to learn how to program. Codio helps make learning to program quick and painless by moving everything to the web.</p>
<!-- 
What hasn't changed, though, is the basic concept of a college course. You'll still be expected to watch or read about 3-4 hours of content to complete each module. In addition to that, each project assignment may require another 3-4 hours of work to complete. If you plan on doing two modules each week, that roughly equates to 6 hours of content and 6 hours of homework each week, which is the expected workload from a 3-4 credit hour college course.
-->
<p>For this course, the only supplies you&rsquo;ll need as a student are access to a modern web browser and a broadband internet connection. No other special hardware or software is necessary!</p>
<p>Finally, as you are aware, this course is always subject to change. This is a relatively new program here at K-State, and we’re always working on new and interesting ideas to integrate into the courses. The best advice I have is to look upon this graphic with the words “Don’t Panic” written in large, friendly letters.  If you find yourself falling behind, or not understanding seek our help via cc110-help.</p>
<p>So, to complete this module, there are a few other things that you&rsquo;ll need to do. The next step is to watch the video on navigating Canvas and Codio, which will give you a good idea of how to most effectively work through the content in this course.</p>
<p>To get to that video, click the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button at the bottom right of this page.</p>

<p>This course makes extensive use of several features of Canvas which you may or may not have worked with before. To give you the best experience in this course, this video will briefly describe those features and the best way to access them.</p>
<p>When you first access the course on Canvas, you will be shown this homepage. It contains quick links to the course syllabus and Piazza discussion boards. This is handy if you just need to jump to a particular area.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through the options in the main menu to the left. The first section is Modules, which is where you&rsquo;ll primarily interact with the course. You&rsquo;ll notice that I&rsquo;ve disabled several of the common menu items in this course, such as Files and Assignments. This is to simplify things for you as students, so you remember that all the course content is available in one place.</p>
<p>When you first arrive at the Modules section, you&rsquo;ll see all of the content in the course laid out in order. If you like, you can minimize the modules you aren&rsquo;t working on by clicking the arrow to the left of the module name. I&rsquo;ll do so, leaving the introductory module open.</p>
<p>As you look at each module, you&rsquo;ll see that it gives quite a bit of information about the course. At the top of each module is an item telling you what parts of the module you must complete to continue. In this case, it says &ldquo;Complete All Items.&rdquo; Likewise, the following modules may list a number of prerequisite modules, which you must complete before you can access it.</p>
<p>Within each module is a set of items, which must be completed in listed order. Under each item you&rsquo;ll see information about what you must do in order to complete that item. For many of them, it will simply say <em>view</em>, which means you must view the item at least once to continue. Others may say <em>contribute</em>, <em>submit</em>, or give a minimum score required to continue. For assignments, it also helpfully gives the number of points available, and the due date.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s click on the first item, Course Introduction, to get started. You&rsquo;ve already been to this page by this point. Many course pages will consist of an embedded video, followed by links to any resources used or referenced in the video, including the slides and a downloadable version of the video. Finally, a rough video script will be posted on the page for your quick reference.</p>
<p>While I cannot force you to watch each video in its entirety, I highly recommend doing so. The script on the page may not accurately reflect all of the content in the video, nor can it show how to perform some tasks which are purely visual.</p>
<p>When you are ready to move to the next step in a module, click the <strong>Next</strong> button at the bottom of the page. Canvas will automatically add <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons to each piece of content which is accessed through the Modules section, which makes it very easy to work through the course content. I&rsquo;ll click through a couple of items here.</p>
<p>At any point, you may click on the Modules link in the menu to the left to return to the Modules section of the site. You&rsquo;ll notice that I&rsquo;ve viewed the first few items in the first module, so I can access more items here. This is handy if you want to go back and review the content you&rsquo;ve already seen, or if you leave and want to resume where you left off. Canvas will put green checkmarks to the right of items you&rsquo;ve completed.</p>
<p>Continuing down the menu to the left, you&rsquo;ll find the usual Canvas links to view your grades in the course, as well as a list of fellow students taking the course.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s go back to Canvas and load up one of the Codio projects. To load the first Codio projects, click the <strong>Next</strong> button at the bottom of this page to go to the next part of this module, which is the Codio Introduction tutorial. On that page, there will be a button to click, which opens Codio in a new browser window or tab.</p>
<p>Once Codio loads, it should give you the option to start the <em>Guide</em> for that module. You&rsquo;ll definitely want to select that option whenever you load a Codio project for the first time.</p>
<p>From there, you can follow the steps in that guide to learn more about the Codio interface. The first page of the guide continues this video. I&rsquo;ll see you there!</p>

<p>If you have issues with the technical content of the course, specifically related to completing the tutorials and projects, there are several resources available to you.
First and foremost, make sure you consult the vast amount of material available in the course modules, including the links to resources.
Usually, most answers you need can be found there.</p>
<p>Of course, as another step you can always exercise your information-gathering skills and use online search tools such as Google to answer your question.
While you are not allowed to search online for direct solutions to assignments or projects, you are more than welcome to use Google to access programming resources such as StackOverflow, language documentation, and other tutorials.
I can definitely assure you that programmers working in industry are often using Google and other online resources to solve problems, so there is no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t start building that skill now.</p>
<p>[Slide 6]</p>
<p>Next, we have grading and administrative issues.
This could include problems or mistakes in the grade you received on a project, missing course resources, or any concerns you have regarding the course and the conduct of instructors and your peers.
Since this is an online course, you&rsquo;ll be interacting with us on a variety of online platforms, and sometimes things happen that are inappropriate or offensive.
There are lots of resources at K-State to help you with those situations.
First and foremost, please email your instructor as soon as possible and let them know about your concern, if it is appropriate for them to be involved.
If not, or if you&rsquo;d rather talk with someone other than your instructor about your issue, I encourage you to contact either your academic advisor, the CS department staff, College of Engineering Student Services, or the K-State Office of Student Life.
Finally, if you have any concerns that you feel should be reported to K-State, you can do so at 

<a href="https://www.k-state.edu/report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.k-state.edu/report/</a>.

<p>Finally, before embarking on this program, let&rsquo;s take a brief minute to review what you&rsquo;ll learn by the time you complete the program.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest and most impactful outcome will be learning how to write computer programs. Throughout the Computational Core program, you&rsquo;ll learn either the Java or Python programming language, and get to a point where you are quite proficient with your language of choice. You&rsquo;ll be capable of building your own programs from scratch to meet many of the challenges you&rsquo;ll encounter in your career or elsewhere. This skill alone will set you well above your peers.</p>
<p>There are many additional benefits beyond just learning how to write programs. For starters, programming involves a large amount of problem solving and computational thinking, and these courses will help sharpen you skills in both areas. In addition to programming, you&rsquo;ll also learn about software engineering methods that will help you build better programs, but also data structures and algorithms that will make your code more efficient and useful as it manipulates and stores data. Of course, you&rsquo;ll also pick up some new math and logic skills, as both are vitally important to understanding computer code. Lastly, we&rsquo;ll spend a bit of time discussing how computers actually work, so you can see how your code actually gets a computer to perform the tasks you desire.</p>
<p>Finally, you may be asking yourself why this is important. I could absolutely bring out large numbers of statistics stating how many computer programming jobs are available right now, and how we have a distinct lack of capable graduates to fill these positions. I could also talk about how much more money you could make as a computer programmer than in many other fields. But, instead, I think it is best to just present this quote from Stephen Hawking, one of the most brilliant people to ever live:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you just want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn. - Stephen Hawking</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just one of the many great quotes encouraging you to learn computer programming from Code.org. I highly recommend checking out their 

<a href="https://code.org/quotes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quote archive</a> whenever you need additional inspiration.</p>
<p>That should cover all of the background information you&rsquo;ll need before you start this program. The rest of this module includes the full course syllabus and a few assignments that you should read through before beginning the course, but you don&rsquo;t have to do anything else for them right now. Finally, this module wraps up with a quick quiz making sure you are 100% ready to take this course.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you on your adventure through this program!</p>

<h4 id="video-script">Video Script</h4>
<p>Before we launch into the course itself, I wanted to take a few minutes to share some information with you regarding what we know about how students learn to program. This isn&rsquo;t just anecdotal evidence from computer science teachers like me, but theories and research from education researchers who study how humans learn new skills and abilities throughout their lives.If I had to summarize all of this information in as few words as possible, I&rsquo;d simply say &ldquo;do the work.&rdquo; Learning to program is difficult, and the only way to really get good at it is through constant practice and learning. However, that greatly oversimplifies the information that I want to share, and I&rsquo;m hoping that you&rsquo;ll find some helpful takeaways from this video that you can incorporate into your learning process.</p>
<p>Before I begin, I want go give all the credit to Nathan Bean for developing this information as part of his CIS 400 course. He graciously allowed me to use his hard work here, and I encourage you to check out his original version, which is available at the URL shown on this slide.</p>
<p>The statement &ldquo;do the work&rdquo; is a shorter version of a very common quote from educators, which is &ldquo;the person doing the work is the person doing the learning.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t find a solid reference for who said it first, so I&rsquo;ll just attributed it to various educators throughout time. This really highlights one of the biggest struggles many students run into when learning to program. There are so many guides online, and the answer to many simple problems can be found through a quick Google search. You can just copy and paste the code, and then your program works. However, did you really <em>learn</em> how to write that program and what it does, or just how to find a quick answer? While this may be a useful tactic from time to time, if you rely too much on other people to do your coding, you really won&rsquo;t learn it yourself. This is just like learning to shoot free throws on a basketball court or beating your best time in a speedrun - you can&rsquo;t just watch someone do it and expect to do it yourself (believe me, I&rsquo;ve tried). So, if you aren&rsquo;t doing the work, you aren&rsquo;t really learning.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s address a major myth in computer science. I&rsquo;ve heard this many times: &ldquo;some people are just natural born programmers, and others simply cannot learn to program.&rdquo; And yes, on the surface, it may appear to be this way. Some students just seem to have a knack for programming, and you may sit and struggle and not really get anywhere. However, there is no innate skill or ability that makes you good at programming.</p>
<p>Instead, let&rsquo;s reframe what it means to learn programming. At its core, programming is learning to write steps to solve problems in a way that a computer can perform those steps. That&rsquo;s really what we are doing when we learn programming.</p>
<p>So, we must focus on learning how to write those steps with the proper exactitude and precision so that they make sense, and we must understand how a computer functions to be able to program that computer effectively. So, when you see someone who is good at programming, it&rsquo;s not because they are good at some esoteric skill that you&rsquo;ll never have - they just know how to express their steps properly and know enough about how a computer works to make their program do what they want. That&rsquo;s really it! And, to be honest, after a single semester of learning to program, you&rsquo;ll have all the skills you need to do both of those things! If you know how to make conditionals, loops, functions, and use simple variables and arrays, that&rsquo;s really all you need. Everything else that comes after that is just refining those skills to make your programs more powerful and your coding more efficient.</p>
<p>So, how do we learn these skills? Well, there are a couple of important pieces we need to make sure are in the right place first. For starters, we need to have the correct mindset. Many times I&rsquo;ll see students struggle to learn how to program, and they&rsquo;ll say things like what you see on this slide. &ldquo;Its too hard.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand this.&rdquo; &ldquo;I give up.&rdquo; Statements like this are the sign of a &ldquo;fixed mindset,&rdquo; and they can be one of the greatest blockers preventing you from really learning to program. Just like learning any other skill, you have to be open to instruction and willing to learn, or else you&rsquo;ve failed before you even started.</p>
<p>Instead, we want to focus on building a growth mindset. In the TED talk by Carol Dweck that is linked below this video, which I encourage you to watch, she talks about the power of &ldquo;yet.&rdquo; We can turn these statements around by simply adding positive power of &ldquo;yet&rdquo; - &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand this yet.&rdquo; &ldquo;I love a good challenge.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep trying until I get it.&rdquo; Going into a programming project with a mindset that is open to growth and change is really an important first steps. When I feel like I&rsquo;m getting a fixed mindset, I like to think about how difficult it would be to teach a child to tie their shoes if they don&rsquo;t want to learn. As soon as I realize that, it is pretty easy to recognize that same problem in myself and work to correct it.</p>
<p>So, once we have our growth mindset, how do we actually learn to program? To understand that, let&rsquo;s dive a bit into the world of educational theory and the work of Jean Piaget. Piaget was a biologist and psychologist who studied how young children acquired new knowledge, and he helped pioneer the concept of Constructivism, one of the most influential philosophies in education. You can read more about Constructivism in the links below this video.</p>
<p>One particular thing that Piaget worked on was a theory of genetic epistemology. Epistemology is the term for the study of human knowledge, so <em>genetic</em> epistemology is the study of the origins, or genesis, of that knowledge. Put more clearly, it&rsquo;s the study of how humans create new knowledge. This concept was inspired by research done on snails - he was able to prove that two previously distinct species of snails were actually the same by moving snails from one habitat to another and observing how they modified their behaviors and how their shells grew to match the snails in the new habitat. Put clearly, the snails displayed an altered behavior based on their environment. They tried to exist in equilibrium with their environment by adapting their behaviors to fit what they now experienced in the word.</p>
<p>Piaget suspected that something similar happens when humans try to learn something - the brain tries to adapt itself to maintain an equilibrium in its environment, which in this case is the existing knowledge it contains. So, when the brain is exposed to new ideas, it must somehow adjust to account for that new information. Piaget proposed two different mechanisms for how this occurs: assimilation and accommodation. In assimilation, new knowledge can be added to existing structures in the brain. For example, if you are exposed to a new color, such as periwinkle, you can see that it falls somewhere between blue and violet, two colors you already know. So, you can assimilate that new knowledge into the existing knowledge without a major disruption to your mental structure of existing colors. Accommodation, on the other hand, happens when your brain must radically adapt to new information for which no existing structures exist. This can be very difficult, and can lead to a lot of struggle and frustration when trying to get &ldquo;over the hump&rdquo; on a new subject. Think about learning algebra or a new language for the first time - you really don&rsquo;t have anything you can use to help understand this new material, so you just have to keep at it until those new structures are formed in your brain.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to achieve accommodation, your brain simply has to build brand new structures to store and represent all of this new information, and that process is difficult and takes time. Put another way, it takes significant stimulus, usually in the form of doing homework, struggling with difficult problems and wrestling with the new information to try and understand it all, to create enough disequilibrium in your brain that, coupled with a growth mindset, will allow accommodation to occur. However, when all the pieces are in the right place, and you work hard and have a growth mindset, then&hellip;</p>
<p>EUREKA! The structures will form, and you&rsquo;ll get over that huge hurdle, and things will start falling into place. It may not happen all at once, but it does happen (you&rsquo;ve probably had it happen to you several times already - think about some eureka moments from your past - were they related to learning a new skill?). Of course, there&rsquo;s a good chance that your brain might form a few incorrect structures in the process, so you&rsquo;ll have to overcome those as you continue to learn. I still struggle to spell some words because my brain formed incorrect structures when I was still learning. But, if you continue to work hard and be open to learning, you&rsquo;ll eventually sort those errors out as well.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at one other concept in education, which is called stage theory. Piaget identified four stages that children go through as they learn to reason about the world. Those four stages are shown on this slide. In the <strong>sensorimotor</strong> stage, the child is just using their senses to interact with the world, without any real understanding of what will happen when they perform an action. This is best represented by babies and toddlers, who touch and taste everything in their surroundings. Next, the <strong>preoperational</strong> stage is represented in young children as they start to think symbolically about the world, using pictures and words to represent actions and objects. They then progress to the <strong>concrete operational</strong> stage, where they can begin to think logically and understand how concrete events happen. They can also start to think inductively, building the general principles of the world from their specific experiences. For example, if they observe that cooked spaghetti is better than raw spaghetti, they might reason that other foods like potatoes are better cooked than raw. Finally, the last stage is the <strong>formal operational</strong> stage. This stage is represented by the ability to work fully with an abstract work, formulating and testing hypotheses to truly understand how the world works and predict how new items will work before experiencing them firsthand.</p>
<p>Many later researchers built upon this model to show that adults learn in much the same way. They also discovered that the stages are not rigid, and you may exhibit behaviors from multiple stages at any given time. This is called the &ldquo;overlapping waves&rdquo; model, and is shown here in this diagram. So, as you learn new skills, you may be at the operational stage in some areas, but still at the preoperational stage in other areas. This explains why some concepts may make sense while others don&rsquo;t for a while - you just have to keep going until it all fits together.</p>
<p>So, how can we apply all of this information to programming? One theory comes from the work of Lister and Teague, who proposed a developmental epistemology of computer programming. Put another way, they applied this theory to computer science education, and gave us a unique way to think about the different stages of learning to program.</p>
<p>At the sensorimotor stage, we&rsquo;re just getting the basics. So, when given a piece of code and asked to trace what it does, we still make lots of errors and get the answer incorrect. If we want to get a program to work ourselves, it usually involves a lot of trial and error, and many times when it does end up working we don&rsquo;t even know exactly <em>why</em> it worked that time, but we&rsquo;re building up a baseline of information that we can use to construct our mental model of how a computer works.</p>
<p>As we progress into the preoperational stage, we become better at tracing code correctly, but we still struggle to understand what the program itself does. We see each line of code as a separate instruction, but not the entire program. A great analogy is reading a recipe that calls for flour, water, salt, and yeast. Will it make bread? Biscuits? Pie crust? We&rsquo;re not sure yet, but at least we can recognize the ingredients. To solve problems at this stage, we typically will randomly adjust pieces of our code that we don&rsquo;t quite understand and see what it does, trying to form a better idea of the importance of each line in the code.</p>
<p>Eventually, we&rsquo;ll get to the concrete operational stage. At this stage, we can construct our own programs, but many times we are simply piecing together parts that we&rsquo;ve used before and performing some futile patches and bugfixes as we refine the program. We can also work backwards to figure out what a program does from execution results, but we still aren&rsquo;t very good at deducing the results from the code itself. However, we&rsquo;re starting to work with abstraction, though we tend to simplify things to a level that we are more comfortable with.</p>
<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll reach the formal operational stage. At this stage, we can comfortable read and understand code without executing it, quickly seeing what it does and how it works without fully tracing it ourselves. We can also start to form hypotheses for how to build new programs and code, and reason about whether different approaches would work better or worse than others. This is the goal stage for any programmer! Once you have reached this stage, then you&rsquo;ll feel totally at home working in code and developing your own programs from scratch.</p>
<p>So, how can we enable ourselves to be the best learners we can be? There is lots of interesting research in that area, best summarized in the book &ldquo;The New Science of Learning&rdquo; that is linked below this video. Let&rsquo;s go through a few of the big concepts.</p>
<p>First, getting ample and regular sleep is important, because it allows your brain to build those knowledge structures we discussed earlier and store the memories from the day in long-term storage. Without enough sleep, your brain is unable to process memories offline and make them ready for retrieval later on, an important step in learning. Also, consuming large amounts of caffeine or alcohol can disrupt your sleep patterns, so keep that in mind before you pour that next cup of coffee or go out partying. You can also take advantage of modern technology to help you track your sleep - most smart watches and smartphones today can help with that!</p>
<p>Likewise, regular exercise is important to both your physical and mental health. When you exercise, especially aerobic exercise that gets your heart rate up, your body releases neurochemicals that help your brain cells communicate. In addition, just getting up and moving around regularly helps keep your body healthy, so take regular breaks, and consider getting a standing desk for some extra benefits.</p>
<p>Research also shows that engaging your senses is an important part in learning. This is why we, as teachers, try to vary our lessons with pictures, videos, activities, and more. It is also the basis of the cognitive apprenticeship style of learning that we use, which you can learn more about in the links below this video. We show you the code we are writing, engaging your sense of vision, while talking about it so you are also listening, and then you are writing your own version, using your sense of touch. You can build upon this by using your senses while you learn by taking notes during a lecture video, building concept maps, and even printing out and writing on your code and these lecture scripts. All of these processes help engage different parts of your brain and make it that much easier to build new knowledge structures.</p>
<p>Looking for patterns is another important way to understand programming. There are many common patterns in computer programs, such as using a for loop to iterate through an array, or an if-else statement to determine if a particular variable is set to a valid value. By recognizing and understanding those patterns, we can more quickly understand new programs that use slightly different versions of the same code. Humans are naturally very good at pattern recognition, and it is one of the reasons why we see the same code structures time and time again - not because they are the only way to accomplish that goal, but because that structure is commonly used across many programs and therefore is easier to understand.</p>
<p>There is quite a bit of research into how memories are formed and how we can adjust our studying habits to take advantage of that. For example, cognitive science shows that the parts of our brain responsible for memory creation are active up to <em>one hour</em> after a learning experience has ended, such as a lecture video or activity. So, instead of jumping to the next task, you may want to take a little while to reflect on what you just did and let it sink in before moving on. Likewise, to build strong memories, it is important to constantly recall the memory or use the skills you&rsquo;ve learned to strengthen their structures in the brain. This is why teachers like to throw in a few questions from a previous exam or quiz every once in a while - it helps strengthen those structures by forcing you to recall information you&rsquo;ve learned previously. On the other hand, many students try to &ldquo;cram&rdquo; a bunch of information right before an exam, only to forget it soon after because it wasn&rsquo;t recalled more than once. As you progress further, we&rsquo;ll continue to come back to concepts you&rsquo;ve already learned and build upon them, a process called <em>elaboration</em> that helps reinforce what you&rsquo;ve already learned while building new, related knowledge.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to remember that we must give our brains the space it needs to focus on the task at hand. Multitasking while learning, such as watching YouTube or Twitch, chatting with friends, or listening to a lecture video while coding can all reduce your brain&rsquo;s ability to form strong memories and do well. In fact, research shows that individuals who try to multitask tend to make 50% more errors and spend 50% more time on both tasks. So, instead of giving yourself distractions, try to find things that will help you focus better - there are some great playlists online for music without lyrics that can help you focus or code better, and you can easily mute notifications on your phone and on your computer for an hour or so while you work.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s summarize what we&rsquo;ve covered here. First, and most importantly, remember that you <em>can</em> learn to program, just like the many students who have done it before you. However, it can be difficult and frustrating at times, and it will take lots of hard work on your part to make it happen. That means that you&rsquo;ll need to read and write <em>a lot</em> of code before it really starts to make sense. In short, you must <strong>do the work</strong> to learn to program.</p>
<p>That said, you can help make the process easier by getting good sleep, exercising regularly, and engaging fully with all of the content in the course. That means you&rsquo;ll need to take your own notes, maybe draw some diagrams, and annotate code you write and code you read to help you understand it. While you are working, try not to multitask so you can focus. If you are given some code to include in your program, don&rsquo;t copy/paste it - rewrite it, and make sure you completely understand what each line does. Finally, take some time to read code written by others! GitHub is a great place to discover all sorts of code and see how others write code. If you want to write good poetry you have to read lots of good poetry, and the same goes for coding.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I hope you are able to make the best of this course and continue to develop your programming skills. If you are interested in this topic and would like to know more about things you can do to be a better learner, let us know! As you can imagine, teachers like me love to talk about this stuff, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask. Good luck!</p>

<h3 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h3>
<p>This course is intended to be taught 100% online, each module is self-paced, and each module must be
completed to progress to the next one. Students are expected to make good progress; we have found
students who fall behind often fail to successfully complete the class.
In general, one or more modules are assigned each week. There are 3 weeks where no new module is
assigned. This is a strong indication that the previous week’s module takes a lot of time (modules 7, 10
and 12).
Modules will contain recorded videos, online tutorials, text and links to online resources. Each module
will include a coding project or assignment, many of which will be graded automatically through Codio.
You will be asked to pick a language by the end of the first week (Java or Python) at which point you will
be invited to a language specific Canvas course. All content is accessed through this second Canvas
course.</p>
<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Each student starts with 0 points in the gradebook and works upward toward a final point total earned
out of the possible number of points. In this course, each assignment constitutes a portion of the final
grade, as detailed below:
70% - Codio Programming Projects
30% - Codio Tutorials and Canvas Quizzes</p>
<p>Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>90% - 100% → A</li>
<li>80% - 89.99% → B</li>
<li>70% - 79.99% → C</li>
<li>60% - 69.99% → D</li>
<li>00% - 59.99% → F</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Read this late work policy very carefully! If you are unsure how to interpret it, please contact the instructors via the help email. Not understanding the policy does not mean that it won&rsquo;t apply to you!</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Since this course is entirely online, students may work at any time and at their own pace through the modules. However, to keep everyone on track, there will be approximately one module due each week. Each graded item in the module will have a specific due date specified. <strong>Any assignment submitted late will have that assignment’s grade reduced by 10% of the total possible points on that project for each day it is late.</strong> This penalty will be assessed automatically in the Canvas gradebook.</p>
<p>Even if a module is not submitted on time, it must still be completed before a student is allowed to begin the next module. So, students should take care not to get too far behind, as it may be very difficult to catch up.</p>
<p>Finally, all course work must be submitted on or before the last day of the semester in which the student is enrolled in the course in order for it to be graded on time.</p>
<p>If you have extenuating circumstances, please discuss them with the instructor as soon as they arise so other arrangements can be made. If you find that you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to make up missed work.</p>
<h3 id="incomplete-policy">Incomplete Policy</h3>
<p>Students should strive to complete this course in its entirety before the end of the semester in which they are enrolled. However, since retaking the course would be costly and repetitive for students, we would like to give students a chance to succeed with a little help rather than immediately fail students who are struggling.</p>
<p>If you are unable to complete the course in a timely manner, please contact the instructor to discuss an incomplete grade. Incomplete grades are given solely at the instructor&rsquo;s discretion. See the official 

<a href="https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/students/academicpolicy/#GRADING" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K-State Grading Policy</a> for more information. In general, <em>poor time management alone is not a sufficient reason for an incomplete grade</em>.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted in writing on a signed 

<a href="https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/forms/Incomplete%20agreement%20form.docx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Incomplete Agreement Form</a>, the following stipulations apply to any incomplete grades given in Computational Core courses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Students may receive at most two incompletes in Computational Core courses throughout their time in the program</li>
<li>Students will be given 6 calendar weeks from the end of the enrolled semester&rsquo;s finals week to complete the course</li>
<li>Any modules in a future CC course which depend on incomplete work will not be accessible until the previous course is finished</li>
<li>For example, if a student is given an incomplete in CC 210, then all modules in CC 310 will be inaccessible until CC 210 is complete</li>
<li>Students understand that access to instructor and GTA assistance may be limited after the end of an academic semester due to holidays and other obligations</li>
<li>If a student fails to resolve an incomplete grade after 6 weeks, they will be assigned an &lsquo;F&rsquo; in the course. In addition, they will be dropped from any other Computational Core courses which require the failed course as a prerequisite or corequisite.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recommended-texts--supplies">Recommended Texts &amp; Supplies</h3>
<p>To participate in this course, students must have access to a modern web browser and broadband internet connection. All course materials will be provided via Canvas and Codio. Modules may also contain links to external resources for additional information, such as programming language documentation.</p>
<h3 id="subject-to-change">Subject to Change</h3>
<p>The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students.</p>

<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one&rsquo;s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the 

<a href="https://www.k-state.edu/honor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honor and Integrity System</a> apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: &ldquo;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.&rdquo; A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.</p>
<p><strong>For this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result in sanctions such as a 0 on the assignment or an XF in the course, depending on severity. Actively seeking unauthorized aid, such as posting lab assignments on sites such as Chegg or StackOverflow or asking another person to complete your work, even if unsuccessful, will result in an immediate XF in the course.</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to use various platforms that can perform automatic plagiarism detection by tracking changes made to files and comparing submitted projects against other students&rsquo; submissions and known solutions. That information may be used to determine if plagiarism has taken place.</p>


<h3 id="students-with-disabilities">Students with Disabilities</h3>
<p>At K-State it is important that every student has access to course content and the means to demonstrate course mastery.

<p>This is our personal policy and not a required syllabus statement from K-State. It has been adapted from 

<a href="https://global.k-state.edu/students/courses/netiquette/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this statement</a> from K-State Global Campus, and the

<a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recurse Center Manual</a>. We have adapted their ideas to fit this course.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Online communication is inherently different than in-person communication. When speaking in person, many times we can take advantage of the <em>context</em> and <em>body language</em> of the person speaking to better understand what the speaker <em>means</em>, not just what is said. This information is not present when communicating online, so we must be much more careful about what we say and how we say it in order to get our meaning across.</p>
<p>Here are a few general rules to help us all communicate online in this course, especially while using tools such as Canvas or Discord:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use a clear and meaningful subject line to announce your topic.</strong> Subject lines such as &ldquo;Question&rdquo; or &ldquo;Problem&rdquo; are not helpful. Subjects such as &ldquo;Logic Question in Project 5, Part 1 in Java&rdquo; or &ldquo;Unexpected Exception when Opening Text File in Python&rdquo; give plenty of information about your topic.</li>
<li><strong>Use only one topic per message.</strong> If you have multiple topics, post multiple messages so each one can be discussed independently.</li>
<li><strong>Be thorough, concise, and to the point.</strong> Ideally, each message should be a page or less.</li>
<li><strong>Include exact error messages, code snippets, or screenshots, as well as any previous steps taken to fix the problem.</strong> It is much easier to solve a problem when the exact error message or screenshot is provided. If we know what you&rsquo;ve tried so far, we can get to the root cause of the issue more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Consider carefully what you write before you post it.</strong> Once a message is posted, it becomes part of the permanent record of the course and can easily be found by others.</li>
<li><strong>If you are lost, don&rsquo;t know an answer, or don&rsquo;t understand something, speak up!</strong> Email and Canvas both allow you to send a message privately to the instructors, so other students won&rsquo;t see that you asked a question. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions anytime, as you can choose to do so without any fear of being identified by your fellow students.</li>
<li><strong>Class discussions are confidential.</strong> Do not share information from the course with anyone outside of the course without explicit permission.</li>
<li><strong>Do not quote entire message chains; only include the relevant parts.</strong> When replying to a previous message, only quote the relevant lines in your response.</li>
<li><strong>Do not use all caps.</strong> It makes it look like you are shouting. Use appropriate text markup (bold, italics, etc.) to highlight a point if needed.</li>
<li><strong>No feigning surprise.</strong> If someone asks a question, saying things like &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t know that!&rdquo; are not helpful, and only serve to make that person feel bad.</li>
<li><strong>No &ldquo;well-actually&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</strong> If someone makes a statement that is not entirely correct, resist the urge to offer a &ldquo;well, actually&hellip;&rdquo; correction, especially if it is not relevant to the discussion. If you can help solve their problem, feel free to provide correct information, but don&rsquo;t post a correction just for the sake of being correct.</li>
<li><strong>Do not correct someone&rsquo;s grammar or spelling.</strong> Again, it is not helpful, and only serves to make that person feel bad. If there is a genuine mistake that may affect the meaning of the post, please contact the person privately or let the instructors know privately so it can be resolved.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid subtle -isms and microaggressions.</strong> Avoid comments that could make others feel uncomfortable based on their personal identity. See the syllabus section on Diversity and Inclusion above for more information on this topic. If a comment makes you uncomfortable, please contact the instructor.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid sarcasm, flaming, advertisements, lingo, trolling, doxxing, and other bad online habits.</strong> They have no place in an academic environment. Tasteful humor is fine, but sarcasm can be misunderstood.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates by adhering to the 

<a href="https://www.k-state.edu/about/values/community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K-State Principles of Community</a>.</p>


<h3 id="face-coverings">Face Coverings</h3>

<h3 id="academic-freedom-statement">Academic Freedom Statement</h3>
<p>Kansas State University is a community of students, faculty, and staff who work together to discover new knowledge, create new ideas, and share the results of their scholarly inquiry with the wider public. Although new ideas or research results may be controversial or challenge established views, the health and growth of any society requires frank intellectual exchange. Academic freedom protects this type of free exchange and is thus essential to any university&rsquo;s mission.</p>
<p>Moreover, academic freedom supports collaborative work in the pursuit of truth and the dissemination of knowledge in an environment of inquiry, respectful debate, and professionalism. Academic freedom is not limited to the classroom or to scientific and scholarly research, but extends to the life of the university as well as to larger social and political questions. It is the right and responsibility of the university community to engage with such issues.</p>


<h3 id="campus-safety">Campus Safety</h3>
<p>Kansas State University is committed to providing a safe teaching and learning environment for student and faculty members.

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.&rdquo; - K-State Honor Pledge</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plagiarism is a very serious concern in this course, and something that we do not take lightly. Computer programs and code are especially easy targets for plagiarism due to how easy it is to copy and manipulate code in such a way that it is unrecognizable as the original source but still performs correctly.</p>
<p>At its core, plagiarism is taking someone else&rsquo;s work and passing it off as your own without giving appropriate credit to the original source. As a student at K-State, you are bound by the K-State Honor Code not to accept any unauthorized aid, and this includes plagiarized code.</p>
<p>When it comes to plagiarism in computer code, there is a fine line between using resources appropriately and copying code. In this program, you should strive to avoid plagiarism issues by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not search for or use any complete solutions to projects in this course found online or from fellow students.</li>
<li>Small portions of code may be used or adapted from an online source with proper citation. To cite a piece of code, include a code comment section above it that contains the original source URL and a description of why it was used.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, copying or adapting small pieces of code to perform auxiliary functions in the assignment is permitted. Copying or adapting code that is the general goal of the assignment should be avoided. For example, if the assignment is to create a bubble sort algorithm, you should write the algorithm from scratch yourself since that is the goal of the assignment. If the assignment is to create a program for displaying data that you feel should be sorted, you may choose to adapt an existing sorting algorithm for your needs (or use one from a library).</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t sure about whether it is OK to use an online resource or piece of code in this course, please contact the instructors using the course discussion forums or help email address. You will not get in trouble for asking, and it will help you determine what the best course of action is. Plagiarism can really only occur when you submit the assignment for grading, so you are welcome to ask for clarification or a judgement on whether a particular usage is acceptable at any time before you submit the assignment.</p>
<p>Codio has features that will compare your submissions against those of your fellow students. Any submissions with a high degree of similarity may be subjected to additional scrutiny by the instructors to determine if plagiarism has occurred.</p>
<p>In this course, any violation of the K-State Honor Code will result in a 0 on that assignment and a report made to the K-State Honor Council. A second violation will result in an XF in this course, as well as any additional sanctions imposed by the K-State Honor Council.</p>

<h1>Welcome to Codio</h1>
<p>Welcome to Codio! For this class, we&rsquo;ll be using Codio for most of our work.  You will access Codio via the links provided in your class materials.</p>
<p>Each module will contain Codio tutorials, Codio projects and occasionally a quiz or discussion.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Next</strong> button below, or the <strong>Right Arrow</strong> at the top of this page, to continue to the next guide page in this Codio project.</p>

<h1>Codio Tutorials</h1>
<p>Each module in Canvas will usually contain two Codio tutorial assignments. Some weeks may have more; in any event module content must be accomplished in order.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first tutorial is a programming language agnostic discussion of the concept the module introduces.  Often this tutorial introduces pseudo code, has questions and may contain a Parsons Puzzle. Most of the questions only allow one attempt, however Parsons Puzzles will allow multiple tries.</li>
<li>The second tutorial will contain your language specific implementation of this concept; the syntax (format) and semantics (behavior/meaning) of the specific keywords.  This tutorial may include a programming example as well as a programming exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these Codio tutorials, there will be several pages of content introducing the material for that module. Some of the pages will look just like this one, with text, images, and maybe even a short video to help you learn the material.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see an outline of the pages available as part of this module, click the &ldquo;hamburger&rdquo; menu button at the top-right of the page.</p>
<p>Some of the pages may also include short questions to check for understanding of the material. You&rsquo;ll need to answer these questions as they appear in order to get points for completing the tutorial module. Remember that the tutorials make up part of your grade in this course, so make sure you answer all of the questions in the tutorial module before submitting it. In some cases, you&rsquo;ll be able to resubmit your answers until you get a correct answer, but other questions will not allow that.</p>
<p>In fact, below is a quick example of what one of those questions would be like. Take a moment to answer the question correctly, then continue to the next page of this module.  For those of you unfamiliar with the work of Douglas Adams, the answer is forty-two.</p>

<h1>Codio Examples</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSdBs1LXddE">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>On some pages, the Codio guide may also switch to a different view, shown here, allowing you to work directly with code. On the far left is the <strong>file tree</strong>, which shows all of the files accessible to you for this tutorial. Then, in the middle, you may also see one or more open files as tabs at the top of that panel. Those files are usually the ones that you need to edit to complete the example on this page. You can freely open additional files if needed in that panel, or rearrange the panels as needed. However, whenever you enter this page, it will reset the view back to the default.</p>
<p>In the first programming module of the course, we&rsquo;ll discuss more information about how to use Codio to run any code that you&rsquo;ve created. For now, we&rsquo;ll just use text files to introduce the interface.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve completed the example, most pages will include a section at the bottom that allows you to check your work. Just like the other questions, these assessments will count toward your grade on the tutorial project. See if you can complete the exercise and pass the test below. The answer is Picard.</p>

<h1>Codio Interface</h1>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve seen a few pages in Codio, let&rsquo;s take a minute to discuss some of the features of the Codio user interface. Of course, Codio has some 

<a href="https://codio.com/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amazing documentation</a>, so feel free to check that out as you work with Codio.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at the menu items at the top of the page. There are several available to you that are worth mentioning. For starters, you can click the <strong>Codio Icon</strong> at any time to go directly to your Codio dashboard.</p>
<p>Under the <strong>Codio</strong> menu, you can also find options to manage your preferences. Here you can adjust things such as the editor settings and theme. Feel free to adjust the settings to match your personal preferences.</p>
<p>The <strong>Project</strong> menu allows you to work with the currently loaded Codio project. Generally you won&rsquo;t need to access many of these items unless your project stops working. However, they are provided for your use in case you need them.</p>
<p>The <strong>File</strong> menu contains options for manipulating the file tree, such as creating new files, renaming them, saving them, and even downloading and uploading files. As you work on larger projects, you&rsquo;ll be using many of these options to manage the files within your project.</p>
<p>Next, the <strong>Edit</strong> menu gives you access to the <em>Undo</em> and <em>Redo</em> action.</p>
<p>The <strong>Find</strong> menu contains entries for searching documents and performing a find-and-replace operation. Most of those actions should be pretty self-explanatory.</p>
<p>The <strong>View</strong> menu allows you to customize your view in Codio. Here we&rsquo;ll find options for managing panels, open tabs, editor settings, and more. Feel free to make use of these options to arrange your Codio view as you prefer. Also, at the bottom of this menu is a <em>Play Guide</em> option, which is very helpful if you accidentally close the guide and need to reopen it.</p>
<p>Under the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, you&rsquo;ll find an option for accessing the <em>Terminal</em> in your project. The Terminal gives you console access to the box that your project is running on.As you work through the content in this program, we&rsquo;ll slowly introduce the Terminal and some of the tasks it can perform.</p>
<p>The <strong>Education</strong> menu is very important, though it only has a single entry. The <em>Mark as Completed</em> option allows you to indicate that you have completed this Codio project or tutorial. Once you select that option, your work will automatically be graded and your grade will be sent to Canvas. From there, you can access the next project or module in the course.</p>
<p>||| warning</p>
<h1 id="dont-submit-projects-accidentally">Don&rsquo;t Submit Projects Accidentally!</h1>
<p>Be very careful when completing a project! Once you&rsquo;ve marked a project as completed, it will become read-only, and you won&rsquo;t be able to make any additional changes to the project. So, you&rsquo;ll need to make sure you&rsquo;ve finished everything in the project first. If you accidentally mark a project as completed, you may contact the instructors for help. Depending on the situation, they may be able to unlock it for you so you can continue your work. However, unlocking a completed project is entirely at the discretion of the instructor.</p>
<p>|||</p>
<p>Finally, the <strong>Help</strong> menu gives you access to many of the support features in Codio. If you get stuck, you may want to review some of the help options available here. Of course, you can always post a message in the course help forum or email for assistance!  This is for help with Codio, not for help on the lesson content.  In general your first request for help should be through the CC210-Help email.</p>
<p>There are also a few other items in the interface you should be aware of. First, in the <strong>File Tree</strong>, there is a <em>Play</em> icon that can also be used to open the guide for the current project.</p>
<p>In the guide, there are a couple of options available by clicking the gear icon in the upper-right of the page. First, there is an option to <em>Restore Current Files</em>. This option will restore the contents of any currently open files back to the default contents from when you first opened the project. In addition, this menu also contains another way to mark the current project as completed.</p>
<p>That covers most of the major features of the Codio interface that we&rsquo;ll be using in this course. If you have any questions about how to use Codio, feel free to ask your teahers or email for assistance.</p>

<h1>Important Notes</h1>
<h2 id="cc-210-is-4-credit-hours">CC 210 Is 4 Credit Hours</h2>
<p>The University guidance is you should spend 12 hours per week on a 4 credit hour course.  We interpret this to mean twelve 50 minute sessions and assume you spend some time studying and reviewing class materials which is not captured in Codio.  Historically, average students come close to this goal, with some weeks going over and the early weeks being low.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/0a-codio-intro/effort.png" alt="Weekly Effort"></p>
<p>Caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>We assume that when given two weeks for a project, the &ldquo;effort&rdquo; is split equally between both weeks.</li>
<li>Students learn different concepts at different rates &ndash; your effort may vary</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Substantially more effort is required to be successful in CC 210 than in CC 110.</strong></p>
<h2 id="modules-1---5-are-mostly-review">Modules 1 - 5 Are Mostly Review</h2>
<h3 id="non-python-students">Non Python Students</h3>
<p>If you are taking CC 210 in a language other than Python, Modules 1 - 5 will quickly introduce you to the basic control statements and variable types in your selected language.  The concepts will be familiar but the application may be a bit more advanced than that which was covered in CC 110.</p>
<h3 id="python-students">Python Students</h3>
<p>If you are taking CC 210 in Python, Modules 1 - 5 may seem like total review.  However, we introduce syntactical and semantic options that, for simplicity&rsquo;s sake, were omitted from CC 110.</p>
<p><strong>Do not become complacent based on the first 3 weeks of course work. This course will become more difficult quickly.</strong></p>
<h2 id="cc-210-projects-vs-cc-110-homeworks-and-labs">CC 210 Projects vs CC 110 Homeworks and Labs</h2>
<h3 id="cut-and-paste-in-projects-is-forbidden">CUT and PASTE in PROJECTS is Forbidden</h3>
<p>We want you to use the Codio editor for your Projects.  It is deliberately feature poor to emphasize the student&rsquo;s knowledge of the language, not the editor&rsquo;s fancy assistance.  See your syllabus, but in general a project which has materials copied/pasted in may receive a 0.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although cut and paste are permitted in TUTORIALs, plagiarism is not. DO NOT paste in someone else&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h3 id="check-it-buttons-may-not-be-comprehensive">&ldquo;Check-It&rdquo; Buttons may not be Comprehensive</h3>
<p>You must develop and test your projects from the terminal.  In CC 110, the student assessment button ran the same test software that the grader did; thus your score on the &ldquo;Check-it&rdquo; button was a true indication of your Codio grade.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/0a-codio-intro/checkit.png" alt="Check It Output"></p>
<p>In CC 210, the &ldquo;Check-it&rdquo; button may be only a small subset the tests run for your Codio grade, so just because you pass those tests does not mean that your project is complete. This also does not guarantee you will receive a passing grade from the actual grader run after you submit your project. <strong>It is your job to test your code thoroughly in the terminal and develop your own test cases.</strong></p>
<h3 id="all-work-is-subject-to-manual-review">All Work is Subject to Manual review</h3>
<p>Your submitted project may be reviewed manual for structure, forbidden commands, proper function from the terminal, etc.  Please see your syllabus.</p>
<p>As a result your the score you receive from Codio may not reflect your final score. Here is the estimated points workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Autograder assigns a grade in Codio and LMS software (e.g. Canvas).</li>
<li>Manual review may deduct some points &ndash; see syllabus.</li>
<li>Plagiarism detection is run and penalties applied.</li>
<li>Late penalties may be applied.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Completing a Unit</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! We&rsquo;ve completed this unit in Codio, and we are now on the last page.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just one more thing to do: we need to mark the unit as complete. When we do that, Codio will grade our work and then send the grade to Canvas. Once the grade is recorded in Canvas, we&rsquo;ll get access to the next item in the module.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle note">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Take a Breather</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve marked a unit complete in Codio, it may take several minutes for the grading process to complete and for your grade to appear in Canvas. So, if you immediately try to access the next item in the module, you may not have access until Codio has submitted your grade to Canvas.</p>
<p>So, once you&rsquo;ve marked a unit as complete, it&rsquo;s a great time to take a quick breather, leave your computer behind, refill your beverage of choice, and clear your mind while Codio and Canvas handle the grading. By the time you get back, your grade should appear in Canvas and you&rsquo;ll be ready to go.</p>
<p>If your grade doesn&rsquo;t appear in Canvas after several minutes, please send a message to the instructors via your class&rsquo;s help system.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>There are several ways to mark a unit as complete. First and foremost, the last page of the guide in each project should have a &ldquo;Mark as Completed&rdquo; button at the bottom of the page, but these textbook tutorials don&rsquo;t. So, once we see that button, we&rsquo;ll know we&rsquo;ve reached the end of a project.</p>
<p>On the tutorials, we can click the gear icon in the upper-right of the page, and select &ldquo;Mark as Completed&rdquo; there. It should also be available in the tutorials as well.</p>
<p>Finally, we can find a &ldquo;Mark as Completed&rdquo; option on the <strong>Education</strong> menu at the top of the window. Each of these will perform the same function, so we can use any one of them when we are finished with our work.</p>
<p>The 

<a href="https://docs.codio.com/students/courses/complete-assignment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codio Documentation</a> gives several different ways that it can be done.</p>
<p>Of course, don&rsquo;t forget the warning on the previous page - we should make sure we are completely done with the unit before marking it as complete.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s go ahead and mark this unit as complete by clicking the &ldquo;Mark as Completed&rdquo; option found by clicking the gear icon above, or the <strong>Education</strong> menu at the top. Once we do that, we&rsquo;ll be able to complete the final few things in Canvas for this module, and then we can move on to Module 1 - Hello World!</p>

<h1>What is Programming?</h1>
<p>As with any learning adventure, we must begin somewhere. When learning how to write computer programs, one of the best questions to tackle first is &ldquo;what is programming?&rdquo; As it turns out, the answer to that question is key to understanding exactly what it is we are trying to learn.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-computer">A Simple Computer</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En7FDq5XrsA">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>

<a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/01-object-oriented-programming/01-what-is-programming/video/">Video Materials</a></p>
<p>At its core, a computer is simply an electronic device that is capable of following instructions to perform calculations. In computer science theory, there is a special kind of theoretical computer called a <em>Turing Machine</em> that represents the simplest version of a modern computer. It might look something like this, as imagined by an artist:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.turing.wikimedia.png" alt="Turing Machine"><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A Turing Machine consists of an infinitely long tape that can be used to store data, and a small control box that manipulates the tape. The control box knows how to perform a few simple instructions, such as &ldquo;Move Left&rdquo; or &ldquo;Write 0.&rdquo; So, to program a Turing Machine, we must simply tell the control box which instructions to follow, and it can do it. For example, if we want the Turing Machine to write &ldquo;101&rdquo; on the tape, we could write the following program:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write 1</li>
<li>Move Right</li>
<li>Write 0</li>
<li>Move Right</li>
<li>Write 1</li>
<li>Stop</li>
</ol>
<p>Seems simple enough. We won&rsquo;t go into the details here, but computer scientists have been able to prove that <em>any</em> computer program that can run on a real computer could also be performed on a Turing Machine, as long as the Turing Machine has infinite time and an infinitely long tape.</p>
<p>This video shows an example of what a Turing Machine might look like in real life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3keLeMwfHY%3fstart%3d200">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>So, all we really need to learn is how to write programs for a Turing Machine, right?</p>
<h2 id="a-modern-computer">A Modern Computer</h2>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.desktopcomputer.wikimedia.svg" alt="Desktop Computer"><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s unfortunately not that simple. There are two major differences between a Turing Machine and a modern computer that we must deal with. First, a modern computer knows many more instructions than a Turing Machine. To learn how to write programs that a modern computer can understand, we&rsquo;d have to learn an entirely different vocabulary of commands. At the same time, modern computers are very complex systems, so any program we write might not be very efficient at doing what we want.</p>
<p>So, to learn how to write computer programs quickly and easily, we really want to be able to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a vocabulary of commands that are familiar to us</li>
<li>Have those commands turn into programs that run efficiently on a modern computer</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="compilers--interpreters-to-the-rescue">Compilers &amp; Interpreters to the Rescue!</h2>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.gracehopper.wikimedia.jpg" alt="Rear Admiral Grace M. Hopper, USN"><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Developing computer programs was very difficult work in the 1950s, and many of those early programmers were looking for a better way to solve that exact problem. One of these was Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, shown above. Her team was one of the first to develop the idea of writing computer programs using English words, and then using a second program, which they called a <em>compiler</em>, to convert those English words into instructions a computer could understand.</p>
<p>Their compiler made developing computer programs much simpler, since programmers didn&rsquo;t have to learn an entirely new vocabulary to tell the computer what to do. Instead programmers simply had to learn the rules of what a computer could and couldn&rsquo;t understand, and the <em>syntax</em>, or grammar rules, of how the compiler expected the program to be written. These new programming languages that use English words are referred to as <em>high-level languages</em>.</p>
<p>Programmers would now write the <em>source code</em> for the program in a high-level language, and then use a compiler to generate the <em>machine code</em> that the computer would actually run. In addition, since the compiler was a program itself, it could make sure the machine code it generated was as fast and efficient as possible, eliminating lots of hard work programmers would have to perform to tailor each program to fit the hardware it was going to run on.</p>
<p>Today, programming languages such as <em>C</em>, <em>C++</em>, and <em>Java</em> use compilers to convert source code into machine code.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.steverussell.wikimedia.jpg" alt="Steve Russell"><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, other developers such as Steve Russell, shown above, were working on another type of program, called an <em>interpreter</em>, to solve the same problem. An interpreter can read source code and immediately tell the computer what steps to perform, without needing to generate the whole machine code first. This makes it much easier to write and edit programs on the fly, as the interpreter reads the source code directly each time the program runs. Today, programming languages such as <em>PHP</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>, and <em>Python</em> use interpreters to run the source code on a computer.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>So, <em>programming</em> is simply the act of writing computer code in a way that a computer can run it. In most cases today, that means developing the <em>source code</em> for a program in a <em>high-level language</em>, then using either a <em>compiler</em> to generate the <em>machine code</em> for that program, or an <em>interpreter</em> to run the program directly on the computer from the source code. Of course, we can always write machine code by hand, but that is quite a bit more difficult.</p>
<p>In this class, we&rsquo;ll learn how to write source code in one of two common languages, Java and Python. They both have their own unique features, especially since Java is a compiled language and Python is an interpreted language. However, as we saw above with the Turing Machine example, each language can be used to write <em>any</em> computer program. So, the choice of language is really more about personal preference and the unique features of each language than anything else.</p>
<p>This makes sense, because in general we can use both English and Spanish, as well as most other languages today, to express the same thoughts and ideas, even if we may not always have a word with the same meaning in both languages.</p>

    <div class="box-content">
<p>A programming language is a complete tool set to translate instructions written in one set of symbols to instructions written in machine binary code.  Both Java and Python do this by producing an intermediate representation (byte code) then translating that to machine code.  In Java&rsquo;s case this byte code is saved, in Python&rsquo;s it is not.</p>

<p>Computer Central Processing Units (CPU) <b>exclusively</b> run machine code.</p>
    </div>
</div>
If you are going to learn to program, you need some idea of how a computer works.  The most basic view of the computer is a bank of memory connected to a Central Processing Unit (CPU). Each byte in memory has its own unique address and an 8-bit value (eight 0s or 1s : 01001101).  This memory is effectively split up into various regions, with  instructions in one region and  data in another.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.1_comp_architecture.png" alt="Simplified View of Computer Architecture"></p>
<p>The CPU has a limited amount of memory (enough to hold a few dozen values) called registers.  It also contains all the circuity to interpret the instructions an perform mathematical and logical operations on the values stored in the registers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Consider the following program, <code>Z = 5 + 7</code>, which instructs the computer add the values of 5 and 7 and save the value into a variable (memory location).  In machine language this many more commands, a simplification might be:</p></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Instruction</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>LVal eax, 0x01A0</td>
<td>Load the value found at memory loc 0x01A0 into reg eax <br>This is where “5” is stored</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>LVal ebx, 0x01A8</td>
<td>Load the value found at memory loc 0x01A8 into reg ebx <br>This is where “7” is stored</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Add eax, ebx</td>
<td>Add the values in registers eax and ebx together and store the result back into eax</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mov eax, 0x01B0</td>
<td>Move the value in register eax to memory location 0x01B0 <br>This is where the variable Z is stored</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Pretty ugly, but this is how the CPU gets its instructions.</p>
<h2 id="estimating-program-state">Estimating Program State</h2>
<p>But from this we can come up with a pretty powerful <strong>abstraction</strong>.  In programing, an abstraction is a simplified model of a complex system, keeping only the most important details to make using the model easy.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.1_program_state.png" alt="Elements of Program State"></p>
<p>Our abstraction will be that a program consists of an ordered list of instructions, a bunch of labeled cubbyholes for data and some pointer that keeps track of which instruction the computer is currently executing.  These things, the list of  instructions, the current instruction and all the values of all the variables are referred to as a program&rsquo;s state.</p>

<h1>The Software Development Lifecycle</h1>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.1_SDC.png" alt="Five Step Software Development Cycle"></p>
<h2 id="requirements-analysis">Requirements Analysis</h2>
<p>Software Development is more than just programming.  It is a disciplined process of converting requirement into finished product.  It consists of five phases, the first of which is requirements analysis.  In requirements analysis you try and describe the problem you are trying to solve and the features you want the solution to have. Throughout CC 210, the exercise or project statement serves as the requirements analysis phase.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>Next comes the design phase.  In design we describe the solution.  In Object-oriented programming this generally consist of designing the classes and the interactions between them which meet the requirements.</p>
<p>A class is a collection of data and the methods (procedures) by which data is accessed and manipulated.  Classes are generally organized around things (the shopping cart from any online store is a classic example) or functions (communication with your computer’s WIFI card is probably handled by a class).  The design of many of CC 210 exercises and projects will be provided to you.</p>
<h2 id="coding-development">Coding (Development)</h2>
<p>Following design is the coding phase, where programs are written to build the design.  This is the emphasis area of CC 210.  Students will code classes, or fragments of classes&ndash;with their associated variables and methods; and test these methods as you write them.</p>
<p>Low level testing is organic to the coding process.  Imagine you were writing the Goldilocks Porridge Temperature Tester, which takes as input a temperature and outputs &ldquo;too hot&rdquo;, &ldquo;too cold&rdquo; or &ldquo;just right&rdquo;.  Better programmers would test their code with a value from each range to make certain the output is correct.  When a program fails a test, it is said to have a &ldquo;bug&rdquo; and the process of finding and fixing bugs is called debugging.</p>
<p>The advantages of testing as you code are</p>
<ol>
<li>that <strong>you</strong> develop the test cases and therefore have a good understanding of what the code is supposed to accomplish and where the problems might be.</li>
<li>Any bugs must have been introduced or revealed by the last bit of code you wrote.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, if you follow a &ldquo;code-a-little-test-a-little&rdquo; approach, you can quickly narrow down the parts of the code which contain the error. If you write too much code before testing any of it, it can be hard to isolate the bugs.</p>
<h2 id="formal-test">Formal Test</h2>
<p>When the coders believe they have a properly working product, the development enters the formal test phase.  Generally, a separate set of developers put the software through its paces and report any bugs they find.  Some of these bugs will be fixed and retested, while others may be left in the code to be addressed at a future date.  When you run the autograder you have effectively entered the formal test phase.</p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>Finally, there is the deployment phase.  This were people and systems start using your code. The analogous activity for CC 210 certifying your module is complete.</p>

<h1>Features of OOP Languages</h1>
<p>We have chosen to approach the computational core from the object-oriented perspective.  Java and Python both support it.  However, it is easier to understand objects (and classes, the name for the code that implements them) after going over a few more fundamental concepts.  Thus, in the first few modules you will be asked to copy some code verbatim, with little explanation.  Alternatively, you may be asked to only write code between certain comment bars, where we have provided the &ldquo;header&rdquo; and &ldquo;footer&rdquo; code necessary to make the program.</p>
<p>Before we begin programming, let&rsquo;s go over some basic terminology and rules for high-level programming languages.</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>First all high programming languages have a syntax, a pattern of words and symbols that correct instructions follow.  When you receive a syntax error, it means the structure of one or more of your instructions does not follow the language&rsquo;s rules.  In a very real sense, this is the grammar that all correct programming lines will follow.</p>
<p>Natural languages also have a grammar, but most natural language listeners can understand improper grammar.  The question &ldquo;Which room is the dog in&rdquo;, containing the dreaded dangling preposition, will almost certainly be correctly interpreted as &ldquo;In which room is the dog&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Programming languages are not like this – the slightest violation of a grammar rule will result in code that most likely will not run.</p>
<h2 id="semantic">Semantic</h2>
<p>Second, all programming instructions have a meaning, called a semantic.  When your program runs but does not do what you thought it would do, this is a semantic error.  Often a semantic error, a bug, occurs when the coder imperfectly understands the effect of the instruction.</p>
<h2 id="initial-vocabulary">Initial Vocabulary</h2>
<p>Finally, all programming languages have &ldquo;parts of speech&rdquo;, by which the languages identify what kind of thing a word (number) is.  Common &ldquo;parts of speech&rdquo; include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>keywords</strong> - a word that has a special meaning. These words tell the program exactly what to do, and we cannot use these words as identifiers.  For example, in both Java and Python the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; is a keyword; you cannot use a keyword for any purpose other than the one(s) intended by the programming language.</li>
<li><strong>literal</strong> – text evaluated as itself, for example numbers (i.e. 6.626) are meant to represent themselves. Similarly, text literals are most often enclosed in double quotation marks (&ldquo;wildcat&rdquo;).  Text literals are most commonly referred to as strings.</li>
<li><strong>identifiers</strong> - any class, method, or variable name is considered an identifier.  Each language will have both rules (syntax) about what can be identifiers and conventions (style guides) about how to construct them.</li>
<li><strong>variable</strong> – a programmer-defined piece of data.  Programmers name their variables with an identifier.</li>
<li><strong>method</strong> - a piece of code that performs an action in our program. Methods are sometimes referred to as functions or subroutines as well, but we&rsquo;ll use the term method.  Programmers name their methods with an identifier.</li>
<li><strong>class</strong> – a collection of variables and the methods used to manipulate that data.  Classes lay at the heart of object-oriented programming and will be the focus of the last third of this course.</li>
<li><strong>symbols</strong> - any non-alphanumeric symbol which has special meaning.  Common ones include the math symbols (+ - / * =), brackets of all forms (() [] {}) and the some not so obvious ones ( .  ,  ;  &quot;  !).</li>
</ul>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle note">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Subroutine, Function, and Method</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Properly, a <strong>subroutine</strong> is a generic term for a named code fragment that does something.  Your programming language may have a subroutine named <code>math.sqrt(x)</code> that calculates the square root of &lsquo;x&rsquo; or one called <code>print (something)</code>  that prints what ever the value of &lsquo;something&rsquo; is to the screen. The <code>print()</code> subroutine may be many lines long, but you gain access to it by calling (using) its name.</p>
<p>The issue is different programming languages use different words to refer to different kinds of subroutines. <strong>Functions</strong> in C may mean a different thing than <strong>functions</strong> in Fortran, Java, Python or mathematics.</p>
<p>We are not going to worry about the details, and will use <strong>method</strong> or occasionally <strong>function</strong> for callable subroutines.</p>

<h1>Structure of an Object-Oriented Program</h1>
<p>An object oriented program contains lots of additional syntax that instructs the compiler or interpreter^[We are going to just use compiler for simplicity&rsquo;s sake] to impose certain conditions when creating the machine- or byte-code.  We will address the details of this syntax after you have learned the necessary background, until then we will just give you the code.</p>
<h2 id="everything-is-in-a-class">Everything Is In a Class</h2>
<p>Classes are the blueprints of objects.  In an object oriented program everything is inside a class definition.  In this class, every file will contain exactly class definition or class-body.</p>

<p>The class-definition is a &ldquo;code-block.&rdquo; Code-blocks signal a boundary to the compiler.  This helps the compiler manage identifier names, memory and other things.</p>
<p>Code-blocks are delimited, or set apart by various symbols.  In Java and pseudo code, this is done with brackets <code>{ code block }</code>.  Spacing is often also used to make the code more readable, everything a block lines up.</p>
<p>In Python each code block is indented to the right; in this class we will use 4-spaces.  When a line ends with a colon, Python expects the next line to be the start of a new code block (and therefore indented).</p>

<p>Pseudo code is typically used to outline the control-flow of a program.  Control-flow refers to the order in which individual statements are executed. The CC courses follow a modified version pseudo code introduced in the AP Computer Science Principles&ndash;Course Exam Description<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.  Pseudo code is intended to be a near English representation of a program.</p>
<h3 id="display">DISPLAY()</h3>
<p>The pseudo code statement <code>DISPLAY(description)</code> does a lot of heavy lifting.  In this context, DISPLAY means visually indicate to the user.  In this course we will run terminal based programs and DISPLAY will typically indicate &ldquo;print to the terminal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, in other contexts <code>DISPLAY</code> could mean send a notification (smart phone), open a pop up (graphical user interface), or even change the speedometer (automotive display controller).</p>
