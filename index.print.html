<p>[Slide 1]</p>
<p>Hello and welcome to the Computational Core program!</p>
<p>My name is Emily Alfs-Votipka, and I&rsquo;ll be one of the instructors for this program. My contact information is shown here, and is also listed on the syllabus.</p>
<!--
My name is Josh Weese, and I’ll be another of the instructors for this program. My contact information is shown here, and is also listed on the syllabus.
Currently, we have two graduate teaching assistants, Farrukh & BreAnn, who will also be working with us to manage these courses.-->
<p>[Slide 2]</p>
<p>There are many other instructors and TAs for this program that you may interact with or see in the tutorial videos. They all have been instrumental in the development of this program.</p>
<p>[Slide 3]</p>
<p>In this course we will primarily use a K-State email group (cc110-help or 

<a href="mailto:cc110-help@ksuemailprod.onmicrosoft.com">cc110-help@ksuemailprod.onmicrosoft.com</a>) to communicate.  Email sent to this address is forwarded to all instructors and TAs.  Our replies to you will also be shared amongst the instructors and TAs so we all have access to the assistance you have already received. We will respond to you within a business day
So a question emailed Friday night may not receive an answer before Monday.</p>
<p>If you wish to pose a discussion topic to you classmates, you should use the discussion feature in Canvas.  Please note that asking a question on a discussion forum is not the same as emailing cc110-help; we will certainly monitor the discussion channels, but not with the same speed as the &ldquo;help line&rdquo;.  Please read and adhere to the guidance on Netiquette in the syllabus for all electronic communications.</p>
<p>[Slide 4]</p>
<p>In addition to email and Canvas, we’ll be using the online learning platform Codio for most of the programming tutorials and projects in this program. We’ll also discuss how to use Codio later in this module.</p>
<p>[Slide 5]</p>
<p>The Computational Core program consists of several courses, and each course contains a number of learning modules. There are about 30 modules in this course. Each module will usually consist of some lecture material and quizzes, and there are a few modules which include a programming component. The modules themselves are gated, which means that you must complete each item in the module in order before continuing. In addition, the modules enforce prerequisite requirements from other modules.  For CC 110 you must complete them in order starting with module 0, the enroll module should be completed first, but is not a prerequisite.</p>
<p>You are welcome to work on this course at any time during the week as your schedule allows, provided that you complete each module before the listed due date. There will be roughly two modules due each week. The modules are self-contained, and nearly all of the grading in this course is completed automatically through Canvas and Codio. So, you can complete modules at any time before the due date, and once a module is complete, you may immediately start on the next one.</p>
<p>[Slide 6]</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the rest of this introductory module, you’ll see that there are a few more items to be completed before you can move on. In the next video, we&rsquo;ll discuss a bit more information about navigating through this course on Canvas and using the Codio learning environment.</p>
<p>[Slide 7]</p>
<p>One thing we highly encourage each of you to do is read the syllabus for this course in its entirety, and let us know if you have any questions. My view is that the syllabus is a contract between me as your teacher and you as a student, defining how each of us should treat each other and what we should expect from each other. We have made a few changes to the standard syllabus template for this program, and those changes are clearly highlighted. Finally, the syllabus itself is subject to change as needed as we adapt this program to meet the needs of its students, and all changes will be clearly communicated to everyone before they take effect.</p>
<p>[Slide 7]</p>
<p>One very important part of the syllabus that every student should read is the late work policy. First off, each module has a due date, and you may work on that module at any time before it is due, provided you have met the prerequisites. As discussed before, you must do all the readings and assignments in a module in listed order before moving on, so you cannot jump ahead. A module is considered completed when all items have been completed.</p>
<p>For the purposes of grading, we will use the date and time that the confirmation quiz was submitted at the end of each module to determine when the module was completed. This is due to the way that Codio handles automated grading, as it may resubmit previously graded assignments if an error in the module is corrected, making a previously completed assignment appear to be submitted late.</p>
<p>If any work is submitted after the due date, a penalty of 10% of the total points possible in that assignment will be deducted for each day it is late, up to a maximum of 3 days. After 3 days beyond the due date, you will receive a 0 on the assignment. Please refer to the full late policy in the syllabus for more information about how late work is handled in this course.</p>
<p>Finally, even if a module is late, it still must be completed before you can move on to a later module. So, it is very important to avoid getting behind in this course, as it can be very difficult to get back on track. If you ever find that you are struggling to keep up, please don&rsquo;t be afraid to contact either the instructors or GTAs for assistance. We&rsquo;d be happy to help you get caught back up quickly.</p>
<!-- 
The grading in this course is very simple. First, 50% of your final grade will depend on the grades you receive from the lecture modules and associated quizzes. Next, 10% of your grade will come from the interactive programming notes and labs in Codio. Another 30% of your grade will be determined by your work completing the programming homework assignments. Finally, the last 10% of your grade will come from your participation in a few interactive discussions throughout the semester.
--> 
<p>In this program, the standard &ldquo;90-80-70-60&rdquo; grading scale will apply, though I reserve the right to curve grades up to a higher grade level at my discretion. Therefore, you will never be required to get higher than 90% for an A, but you may get an A if you score slightly below 90% if I choose to curve the grades.</p>
<p>This is intended to be a completely online, self-paced course. There are no mandatory scheduled course times. All of the content is available online, so you can work whenever and wherever you want. It could be a 3-hour block once a week, or a few minutes here and there between classes. It’s really up to you and your schedule. However, remember that each module may require 4 to 6 or more hours of work to complete, so make sure you have plenty of time available to devote to this course.</p>
<p>Also, a vast majority of the grading in this course will be handled automatically through Canvas and Codio. This means that you&rsquo;ll be able to receive feedback directly from those systems as soon as you submit your work. You may also contact the instructors and GTAs for additional tips and feedback regarding your work, but depending on the number of students in the program, we may not be able to review every student submission directly.</p>
<p>In addition, due to the flexible online format of this class, there won&rsquo;t be any long lecture videos to watch. Instead, each module will consist of a guided tutorial and several short videos, each focused on a particular topic or task. Likewise, there won&rsquo;t be any textbooks required, since all of the information will be presented in the interactive tutorials through Codio. Finally, since we are using Codio as our learning platform, you won&rsquo;t have to deal with installing and using a clunky integrated development environment, or IDE, just to learn how to program. Codio helps make learning to program quick and painless by moving everything to the web.</p>
<!-- 
What hasn't changed, though, is the basic concept of a college course. You'll still be expected to watch or read about 3-4 hours of content to complete each module. In addition to that, each project assignment may require another 3-4 hours of work to complete. If you plan on doing two modules each week, that roughly equates to 6 hours of content and 6 hours of homework each week, which is the expected workload from a 3-4 credit hour college course.
-->
<p>For this course, the only supplies you&rsquo;ll need as a student are access to a modern web browser and a broadband internet connection. No other special hardware or software is necessary!</p>
<p>Finally, as you are aware, this course is always subject to change. This is a relatively new program here at K-State, and we’re always working on new and interesting ideas to integrate into the courses. The best advice I have is to look upon this graphic with the words “Don’t Panic” written in large, friendly letters.  If you find yourself falling behind, or not understanding seek our help via cc110-help.</p>
<p>So, to complete this module, there are a few other things that you&rsquo;ll need to do. The next step is to watch the video on navigating Canvas and Codio, which will give you a good idea of how to most effectively work through the content in this course.</p>
<p>To get to that video, click the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button at the bottom right of this page.</p>

<p>This course makes extensive use of several features of Canvas which you may or may not have worked with before. To give you the best experience in this course, this video will briefly describe those features and the best way to access them.</p>
<p>When you first access the course on Canvas, you will be shown this homepage. It contains quick links to the course syllabus and Piazza discussion boards. This is handy if you just need to jump to a particular area.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through the options in the main menu to the left. The first section is Modules, which is where you&rsquo;ll primarily interact with the course. You&rsquo;ll notice that I&rsquo;ve disabled several of the common menu items in this course, such as Files and Assignments. This is to simplify things for you as students, so you remember that all the course content is available in one place.</p>
<p>When you first arrive at the Modules section, you&rsquo;ll see all of the content in the course laid out in order. If you like, you can minimize the modules you aren&rsquo;t working on by clicking the arrow to the left of the module name. I&rsquo;ll do so, leaving the introductory module open.</p>
<p>As you look at each module, you&rsquo;ll see that it gives quite a bit of information about the course. At the top of each module is an item telling you what parts of the module you must complete to continue. In this case, it says &ldquo;Complete All Items.&rdquo; Likewise, the following modules may list a number of prerequisite modules, which you must complete before you can access it.</p>
<p>Within each module is a set of items, which must be completed in listed order. Under each item you&rsquo;ll see information about what you must do in order to complete that item. For many of them, it will simply say <em>view</em>, which means you must view the item at least once to continue. Others may say <em>contribute</em>, <em>submit</em>, or give a minimum score required to continue. For assignments, it also helpfully gives the number of points available, and the due date.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s click on the first item, Course Introduction, to get started. You&rsquo;ve already been to this page by this point. Many course pages will consist of an embedded video, followed by links to any resources used or referenced in the video, including the slides and a downloadable version of the video. Finally, a rough video script will be posted on the page for your quick reference.</p>
<p>While I cannot force you to watch each video in its entirety, I highly recommend doing so. The script on the page may not accurately reflect all of the content in the video, nor can it show how to perform some tasks which are purely visual.</p>
<p>When you are ready to move to the next step in a module, click the <strong>Next</strong> button at the bottom of the page. Canvas will automatically add <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons to each piece of content which is accessed through the Modules section, which makes it very easy to work through the course content. I&rsquo;ll click through a couple of items here.</p>
<p>At any point, you may click on the Modules link in the menu to the left to return to the Modules section of the site. You&rsquo;ll notice that I&rsquo;ve viewed the first few items in the first module, so I can access more items here. This is handy if you want to go back and review the content you&rsquo;ve already seen, or if you leave and want to resume where you left off. Canvas will put green checkmarks to the right of items you&rsquo;ve completed.</p>
<p>Continuing down the menu to the left, you&rsquo;ll find the usual Canvas links to view your grades in the course, as well as a list of fellow students taking the course.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s go back to Canvas and load up one of the Codio projects. To load the first Codio projects, click the <strong>Next</strong> button at the bottom of this page to go to the next part of this module, which is the Codio Introduction tutorial. On that page, there will be a button to click, which opens Codio in a new browser window or tab.</p>
<p>Once Codio loads, it should give you the option to start the <em>Guide</em> for that module. You&rsquo;ll definitely want to select that option whenever you load a Codio project for the first time.</p>
<p>From there, you can follow the steps in that guide to learn more about the Codio interface. The first page of the guide continues this video. I&rsquo;ll see you there!</p>

<p>Finally, before embarking on this program, let&rsquo;s take a brief minute to review what you&rsquo;ll learn by the time you complete the program.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest and most impactful outcome will be learning how to write computer programs. Throughout the Computational Core program, you&rsquo;ll learn either the Java or Python programming language, and get to a point where you are quite proficient with your language of choice. You&rsquo;ll be capable of building your own programs from scratch to meet many of the challenges you&rsquo;ll encounter in your career or elsewhere. This skill alone will set you well above your peers.</p>
<p>There are many additional benefits beyond just learning how to write programs. For starters, programming involves a large amount of problem solving and computational thinking, and these courses will help sharpen you skills in both areas. In addition to programming, you&rsquo;ll also learn about software engineering methods that will help you build better programs, but also data structures and algorithms that will make your code more efficient and useful as it manipulates and stores data. Of course, you&rsquo;ll also pick up some new math and logic skills, as both are vitally important to understanding computer code. Lastly, we&rsquo;ll spend a bit of time discussing how computers actually work, so you can see how your code actually gets a computer to perform the tasks you desire.</p>
<p>Finally, you may be asking yourself why this is important. I could absolutely bring out large numbers of statistics stating how many computer programming jobs are available right now, and how we have a distinct lack of capable graduates to fill these positions. I could also talk about how much more money you could make as a computer programmer than in many other fields. But, instead, I think it is best to just present this quote from Stephen Hawking, one of the most brilliant people to ever live:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you just want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn. - Stephen Hawking</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just one of the many great quotes encouraging you to learn computer programming from Code.org. I highly recommend checking out their 

<a href="https://code.org/quotes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quote archive</a> whenever you need additional inspiration.</p>
<p>That should cover all of the background information you&rsquo;ll need before you start this program. The rest of this module includes the full course syllabus and a few assignments that you should read through before beginning the course, but you don&rsquo;t have to do anything else for them right now. Finally, this module wraps up with a quick quiz making sure you are 100% ready to take this course.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you on your adventure through this program!</p>

<h4 id="video-script">Video Script</h4>
<p>Before we launch into the course itself, I wanted to take a few minutes to share some information with you regarding what we know about how students learn to program. This isn&rsquo;t just anecdotal evidence from computer science teachers like me, but theories and research from education researchers who study how humans learn new skills and abilities throughout their lives.If I had to summarize all of this information in as few words as possible, I&rsquo;d simply say &ldquo;do the work.&rdquo; Learning to program is difficult, and the only way to really get good at it is through constant practice and learning. However, that greatly oversimplifies the information that I want to share, and I&rsquo;m hoping that you&rsquo;ll find some helpful takeaways from this video that you can incorporate into your learning process.</p>
<p>Before I begin, I want go give all the credit to Nathan Bean for developing this information as part of his CIS 400 course. He graciously allowed me to use his hard work here, and I encourage you to check out his original version, which is available at the URL shown on this slide.</p>
<p>The statement &ldquo;do the work&rdquo; is a shorter version of a very common quote from educators, which is &ldquo;the person doing the work is the person doing the learning.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t find a solid reference for who said it first, so I&rsquo;ll just attributed it to various educators throughout time. This really highlights one of the biggest struggles many students run into when learning to program. There are so many guides online, and the answer to many simple problems can be found through a quick Google search. You can just copy and paste the code, and then your program works. However, did you really <em>learn</em> how to write that program and what it does, or just how to find a quick answer? While this may be a useful tactic from time to time, if you rely too much on other people to do your coding, you really won&rsquo;t learn it yourself. This is just like learning to shoot free throws on a basketball court or beating your best time in a speedrun - you can&rsquo;t just watch someone do it and expect to do it yourself (believe me, I&rsquo;ve tried). So, if you aren&rsquo;t doing the work, you aren&rsquo;t really learning.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s address a major myth in computer science. I&rsquo;ve heard this many times: &ldquo;some people are just natural born programmers, and others simply cannot learn to program.&rdquo; And yes, on the surface, it may appear to be this way. Some students just seem to have a knack for programming, and you may sit and struggle and not really get anywhere. However, there is no innate skill or ability that makes you good at programming.</p>
<p>Instead, let&rsquo;s reframe what it means to learn programming. At its core, programming is learning to write steps to solve problems in a way that a computer can perform those steps. That&rsquo;s really what we are doing when we learn programming.</p>
<p>So, we must focus on learning how to write those steps with the proper exactitude and precision so that they make sense, and we must understand how a computer functions to be able to program that computer effectively. So, when you see someone who is good at programming, it&rsquo;s not because they are good at some esoteric skill that you&rsquo;ll never have - they just know how to express their steps properly and know enough about how a computer works to make their program do what they want. That&rsquo;s really it! And, to be honest, after a single semester of learning to program, you&rsquo;ll have all the skills you need to do both of those things! If you know how to make conditionals, loops, functions, and use simple variables and arrays, that&rsquo;s really all you need. Everything else that comes after that is just refining those skills to make your programs more powerful and your coding more efficient.</p>
<p>So, how do we learn these skills? Well, there are a couple of important pieces we need to make sure are in the right place first. For starters, we need to have the correct mindset. Many times I&rsquo;ll see students struggle to learn how to program, and they&rsquo;ll say things like what you see on this slide. &ldquo;Its too hard.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand this.&rdquo; &ldquo;I give up.&rdquo; Statements like this are the sign of a &ldquo;fixed mindset,&rdquo; and they can be one of the greatest blockers preventing you from really learning to program. Just like learning any other skill, you have to be open to instruction and willing to learn, or else you&rsquo;ve failed before you even started.</p>
<p>Instead, we want to focus on building a growth mindset. In the TED talk by Carol Dweck that is linked below this video, which I encourage you to watch, she talks about the power of &ldquo;yet.&rdquo; We can turn these statements around by simply adding positive power of &ldquo;yet&rdquo; - &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand this yet.&rdquo; &ldquo;I love a good challenge.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep trying until I get it.&rdquo; Going into a programming project with a mindset that is open to growth and change is really an important first steps. When I feel like I&rsquo;m getting a fixed mindset, I like to think about how difficult it would be to teach a child to tie their shoes if they don&rsquo;t want to learn. As soon as I realize that, it is pretty easy to recognize that same problem in myself and work to correct it.</p>
<p>So, once we have our growth mindset, how do we actually learn to program? To understand that, let&rsquo;s dive a bit into the world of educational theory and the work of Jean Piaget. Piaget was a biologist and psychologist who studied how young children acquired new knowledge, and he helped pioneer the concept of Constructivism, one of the most influential philosophies in education. You can read more about Constructivism in the links below this video.</p>
<p>One particular thing that Piaget worked on was a theory of genetic epistemology. Epistemology is the term for the study of human knowledge, so <em>genetic</em> epistemology is the study of the origins, or genesis, of that knowledge. Put more clearly, it&rsquo;s the study of how humans create new knowledge. This concept was inspired by research done on snails - he was able to prove that two previously distinct species of snails were actually the same by moving snails from one habitat to another and observing how they modified their behaviors and how their shells grew to match the snails in the new habitat. Put clearly, the snails displayed an altered behavior based on their environment. They tried to exist in equilibrium with their environment by adapting their behaviors to fit what they now experienced in the word.</p>
<p>Piaget suspected that something similar happens when humans try to learn something - the brain tries to adapt itself to maintain an equilibrium in its environment, which in this case is the existing knowledge it contains. So, when the brain is exposed to new ideas, it must somehow adjust to account for that new information. Piaget proposed two different mechanisms for how this occurs: assimilation and accommodation. In assimilation, new knowledge can be added to existing structures in the brain. For example, if you are exposed to a new color, such as periwinkle, you can see that it falls somewhere between blue and violet, two colors you already know. So, you can assimilate that new knowledge into the existing knowledge without a major disruption to your mental structure of existing colors. Accommodation, on the other hand, happens when your brain must radically adapt to new information for which no existing structures exist. This can be very difficult, and can lead to a lot of struggle and frustration when trying to get &ldquo;over the hump&rdquo; on a new subject. Think about learning algebra or a new language for the first time - you really don&rsquo;t have anything you can use to help understand this new material, so you just have to keep at it until those new structures are formed in your brain.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to achieve accommodation, your brain simply has to build brand new structures to store and represent all of this new information, and that process is difficult and takes time. Put another way, it takes significant stimulus, usually in the form of doing homework, struggling with difficult problems and wrestling with the new information to try and understand it all, to create enough disequilibrium in your brain that, coupled with a growth mindset, will allow accommodation to occur. However, when all the pieces are in the right place, and you work hard and have a growth mindset, then&hellip;</p>
<p>EUREKA! The structures will form, and you&rsquo;ll get over that huge hurdle, and things will start falling into place. It may not happen all at once, but it does happen (you&rsquo;ve probably had it happen to you several times already - think about some eureka moments from your past - were they related to learning a new skill?). Of course, there&rsquo;s a good chance that your brain might form a few incorrect structures in the process, so you&rsquo;ll have to overcome those as you continue to learn. I still struggle to spell some words because my brain formed incorrect structures when I was still learning. But, if you continue to work hard and be open to learning, you&rsquo;ll eventually sort those errors out as well.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at one other concept in education, which is called stage theory. Piaget identified four stages that children go through as they learn to reason about the world. Those four stages are shown on this slide. In the <strong>sensorimotor</strong> stage, the child is just using their senses to interact with the world, without any real understanding of what will happen when they perform an action. This is best represented by babies and toddlers, who touch and taste everything in their surroundings. Next, the <strong>preoperational</strong> stage is represented in young children as they start to think symbolically about the world, using pictures and words to represent actions and objects. They then progress to the <strong>concrete operational</strong> stage, where they can begin to think logically and understand how concrete events happen. They can also start to think inductively, building the general principles of the world from their specific experiences. For example, if they observe that cooked spaghetti is better than raw spaghetti, they might reason that other foods like potatoes are better cooked than raw. Finally, the last stage is the <strong>formal operational</strong> stage. This stage is represented by the ability to work fully with an abstract work, formulating and testing hypotheses to truly understand how the world works and predict how new items will work before experiencing them firsthand.</p>
<p>Many later researchers built upon this model to show that adults learn in much the same way. They also discovered that the stages are not rigid, and you may exhibit behaviors from multiple stages at any given time. This is called the &ldquo;overlapping waves&rdquo; model, and is shown here in this diagram. So, as you learn new skills, you may be at the operational stage in some areas, but still at the preoperational stage in other areas. This explains why some concepts may make sense while others don&rsquo;t for a while - you just have to keep going until it all fits together.</p>
<p>So, how can we apply all of this information to programming? One theory comes from the work of Lister and Teague, who proposed a developmental epistemology of computer programming. Put another way, they applied this theory to computer science education, and gave us a unique way to think about the different stages of learning to program.</p>
<p>At the sensorimotor stage, we&rsquo;re just getting the basics. So, when given a piece of code and asked to trace what it does, we still make lots of errors and get the answer incorrect. If we want to get a program to work ourselves, it usually involves a lot of trial and error, and many times when it does end up working we don&rsquo;t even know exactly <em>why</em> it worked that time, but we&rsquo;re building up a baseline of information that we can use to construct our mental model of how a computer works.</p>
<p>As we progress into the preoperational stage, we become better at tracing code correctly, but we still struggle to understand what the program itself does. We see each line of code as a separate instruction, but not the entire program. A great analogy is reading a recipe that calls for flour, water, salt, and yeast. Will it make bread? Biscuits? Pie crust? We&rsquo;re not sure yet, but at least we can recognize the ingredients. To solve problems at this stage, we typically will randomly adjust pieces of our code that we don&rsquo;t quite understand and see what it does, trying to form a better idea of the importance of each line in the code.</p>
<p>Eventually, we&rsquo;ll get to the concrete operational stage. At this stage, we can construct our own programs, but many times we are simply piecing together parts that we&rsquo;ve used before and performing some futile patches and bugfixes as we refine the program. We can also work backwards to figure out what a program does from execution results, but we still aren&rsquo;t very good at deducing the results from the code itself. However, we&rsquo;re starting to work with abstraction, though we tend to simplify things to a level that we are more comfortable with.</p>
<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll reach the formal operational stage. At this stage, we can comfortable read and understand code without executing it, quickly seeing what it does and how it works without fully tracing it ourselves. We can also start to form hypotheses for how to build new programs and code, and reason about whether different approaches would work better or worse than others. This is the goal stage for any programmer! Once you have reached this stage, then you&rsquo;ll feel totally at home working in code and developing your own programs from scratch.</p>
<p>So, how can we enable ourselves to be the best learners we can be? There is lots of interesting research in that area, best summarized in the book &ldquo;The New Science of Learning&rdquo; that is linked below this video. Let&rsquo;s go through a few of the big concepts.</p>
<p>First, getting ample and regular sleep is important, because it allows your brain to build those knowledge structures we discussed earlier and store the memories from the day in long-term storage. Without enough sleep, your brain is unable to process memories offline and make them ready for retrieval later on, an important step in learning. Also, consuming large amounts of caffeine or alcohol can disrupt your sleep patterns, so keep that in mind before you pour that next cup of coffee or go out partying. You can also take advantage of modern technology to help you track your sleep - most smart watches and smartphones today can help with that!</p>
<p>Likewise, regular exercise is important to both your physical and mental health. When you exercise, especially aerobic exercise that gets your heart rate up, your body releases neurochemicals that help your brain cells communicate. In addition, just getting up and moving around regularly helps keep your body healthy, so take regular breaks, and consider getting a standing desk for some extra benefits.</p>
<p>Research also shows that engaging your senses is an important part in learning. This is why we, as teachers, try to vary our lessons with pictures, videos, activities, and more. It is also the basis of the cognitive apprenticeship style of learning that we use, which you can learn more about in the links below this video. We show you the code we are writing, engaging your sense of vision, while talking about it so you are also listening, and then you are writing your own version, using your sense of touch. You can build upon this by using your senses while you learn by taking notes during a lecture video, building concept maps, and even printing out and writing on your code and these lecture scripts. All of these processes help engage different parts of your brain and make it that much easier to build new knowledge structures.</p>
<p>Looking for patterns is another important way to understand programming. There are many common patterns in computer programs, such as using a for loop to iterate through an array, or an if-else statement to determine if a particular variable is set to a valid value. By recognizing and understanding those patterns, we can more quickly understand new programs that use slightly different versions of the same code. Humans are naturally very good at pattern recognition, and it is one of the reasons why we see the same code structures time and time again - not because they are the only way to accomplish that goal, but because that structure is commonly used across many programs and therefore is easier to understand.</p>
<p>There is quite a bit of research into how memories are formed and how we can adjust our studying habits to take advantage of that. For example, cognitive science shows that the parts of our brain responsible for memory creation are active up to <em>one hour</em> after a learning experience has ended, such as a lecture video or activity. So, instead of jumping to the next task, you may want to take a little while to reflect on what you just did and let it sink in before moving on. Likewise, to build strong memories, it is important to constantly recall the memory or use the skills you&rsquo;ve learned to strengthen their structures in the brain. This is why teachers like to throw in a few questions from a previous exam or quiz every once in a while - it helps strengthen those structures by forcing you to recall information you&rsquo;ve learned previously. On the other hand, many students try to &ldquo;cram&rdquo; a bunch of information right before an exam, only to forget it soon after because it wasn&rsquo;t recalled more than once. As you progress further, we&rsquo;ll continue to come back to concepts you&rsquo;ve already learned and build upon them, a process called <em>elaboration</em> that helps reinforce what you&rsquo;ve already learned while building new, related knowledge.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to remember that we must give our brains the space it needs to focus on the task at hand. Multitasking while learning, such as watching YouTube or Twitch, chatting with friends, or listening to a lecture video while coding can all reduce your brain&rsquo;s ability to form strong memories and do well. In fact, research shows that individuals who try to multitask tend to make 50% more errors and spend 50% more time on both tasks. So, instead of giving yourself distractions, try to find things that will help you focus better - there are some great playlists online for music without lyrics that can help you focus or code better, and you can easily mute notifications on your phone and on your computer for an hour or so while you work.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s summarize what we&rsquo;ve covered here. First, and most importantly, remember that you <em>can</em> learn to program, just like the many students who have done it before you. However, it can be difficult and frustrating at times, and it will take lots of hard work on your part to make it happen. That means that you&rsquo;ll need to read and write <em>a lot</em> of code before it really starts to make sense. In short, you must <strong>do the work</strong> to learn to program.</p>
<p>That said, you can help make the process easier by getting good sleep, exercising regularly, and engaging fully with all of the content in the course. That means you&rsquo;ll need to take your own notes, maybe draw some diagrams, and annotate code you write and code you read to help you understand it. While you are working, try not to multitask so you can focus. If you are given some code to include in your program, don&rsquo;t copy/paste it - rewrite it, and make sure you completely understand what each line does. Finally, take some time to read code written by others! GitHub is a great place to discover all sorts of code and see how others write code. If you want to write good poetry you have to read lots of good poetry, and the same goes for coding.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I hope you are able to make the best of this course and continue to develop your programming skills. If you are interested in this topic and would like to know more about things you can do to be a better learner, let us know! As you can imagine, teachers like me love to talk about this stuff, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask. Good luck!</p>

<h3 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h3>
<p>This course is intended to be taught 100% online, each module is self-paced, and each module must be
completed to progress to the next one. Students are expected to make good progress; we have found
students who fall behind often fail to successfully complete the class.
In general, one or more modules are assigned each week. There are 3 weeks where no new module is
assigned. This is a strong indication that the previous week’s module takes a lot of time (modules 7, 10
and 12).
Modules will contain recorded videos, online tutorials, text and links to online resources. Each module
will include a coding project or assignment, many of which will be graded automatically through Codio.
You will be asked to pick a language by the end of the first week (Java or Python) at which point you will
be invited to a language specific Canvas course. All content is accessed through this second Canvas
course.</p>
<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Each student starts with 0 points in the gradebook and works upward toward a final point total earned
out of the possible number of points. In this course, each assignment constitutes a portion of the final
grade, as detailed below:
70% - Codio Programming Projects
30% - Codio Tutorials and Canvas Quizzes</p>
<p>Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>90% - 100% → A</li>
<li>80% - 89.99% → B</li>
<li>70% - 79.99% → C</li>
<li>60% - 69.99% → D</li>
<li>00% - 59.99% → F</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Read this late work policy very carefully! If you are unsure how to interpret it, please contact the instructors via the help email. Not understanding the policy does not mean that it won&rsquo;t apply to you!</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Since this course is entirely online, students may work at any time and at their own pace through the modules. However, to keep everyone on track, there will be approximately one module due each week. Each graded item in the module will have a specific due date specified. <strong>Any assignment submitted late will have that assignment’s grade reduced by 10% of the total possible points on that project for each day it is late.</strong> This penalty will be assessed automatically in the Canvas gradebook.</p>
<p>Even if a module is not submitted on time, it must still be completed before a student is allowed to begin the next module. So, students should take care not to get too far behind, as it may be very difficult to catch up.</p>
<p>Finally, all course work must be submitted on or before the last day of the semester in which the student is enrolled in the course in order for it to be graded on time.</p>
<p>If you have extenuating circumstances, please discuss them with the instructor as soon as they arise so other arrangements can be made. If you find that you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to make up missed work.</p>
<h3 id="incomplete-policy">Incomplete Policy</h3>
<p>Students should strive to complete this course in its entirety before the end of the semester in which they are enrolled. However, since retaking the course would be costly and repetitive for students, we would like to give students a chance to succeed with a little help rather than immediately fail students who are struggling.</p>
<p>If you are unable to complete the course in a timely manner, please contact the instructor to discuss an incomplete grade. Incomplete grades are given solely at the instructor&rsquo;s discretion. See the official 

<a href="https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/students/academicpolicy/#GRADING" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K-State Grading Policy</a> for more information. In general, <em>poor time management alone is not a sufficient reason for an incomplete grade</em>.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted in writing on a signed 

<a href="https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/forms/Incomplete%20agreement%20form.docx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Incomplete Agreement Form</a>, the following stipulations apply to any incomplete grades given in Computational Core courses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Students may receive at most two incompletes in Computational Core courses throughout their time in the program</li>
<li>Students will be given 6 calendar weeks from the end of the enrolled semester&rsquo;s finals week to complete the course</li>
<li>Any modules in a future CC course which depend on incomplete work will not be accessible until the previous course is finished</li>
<li>For example, if a student is given an incomplete in CC 210, then all modules in CC 310 will be inaccessible until CC 210 is complete</li>
<li>Students understand that access to instructor and GTA assistance may be limited after the end of an academic semester due to holidays and other obligations</li>
<li>If a student fails to resolve an incomplete grade after 6 weeks, they will be assigned an &lsquo;F&rsquo; in the course. In addition, they will be dropped from any other Computational Core courses which require the failed course as a prerequisite or corequisite.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recommended-texts--supplies">Recommended Texts &amp; Supplies</h3>
<p>To participate in this course, students must have access to a modern web browser and broadband internet connection. All course materials will be provided via Canvas and Codio. Modules may also contain links to external resources for additional information, such as programming language documentation.</p>
<h3 id="subject-to-change">Subject to Change</h3>
<p>The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students.</p>

<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one&rsquo;s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the 

<a href="https://www.k-state.edu/honor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honor and Integrity System</a> apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: &ldquo;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.&rdquo; A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.</p>
<p><strong>For this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result in sanctions such as a 0 on the assignment or an XF in the course, depending on severity. Actively seeking unauthorized aid, such as posting lab assignments on sites such as Chegg or StackOverflow or asking another person to complete your work, even if unsuccessful, will result in an immediate XF in the course.</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to use various platforms that can perform automatic plagiarism detection by tracking changes made to files and comparing submitted projects against other students&rsquo; submissions and known solutions. That information may be used to determine if plagiarism has taken place.</p>


<h3 id="students-with-disabilities">Students with Disabilities</h3>

<p>This is our personal policy and not a required syllabus statement from K-State. It has been adapted from 

<a href="https://global.k-state.edu/students/courses/netiquette/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this statement</a> from K-State Global Campus, and the

    </div>
</div>
<p>Online communication is inherently different than in-person communication. When speaking in person, many times we can take advantage of the <em>context</em> and <em>body language</em> of the person speaking to better understand what the speaker <em>means</em>, not just what is said. This information is not present when communicating online, so we must be much more careful about what we say and how we say it in order to get our meaning across.</p>
<p>Here are a few general rules to help us all communicate online in this course, especially while using tools such as Canvas or Discord:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use a clear and meaningful subject line to announce your topic.</strong> Subject lines such as &ldquo;Question&rdquo; or &ldquo;Problem&rdquo; are not helpful. Subjects such as &ldquo;Logic Question in Project 5, Part 1 in Java&rdquo; or &ldquo;Unexpected Exception when Opening Text File in Python&rdquo; give plenty of information about your topic.</li>
<li><strong>Use only one topic per message.</strong> If you have multiple topics, post multiple messages so each one can be discussed independently.</li>
<li><strong>Be thorough, concise, and to the point.</strong> Ideally, each message should be a page or less.</li>
<li><strong>Include exact error messages, code snippets, or screenshots, as well as any previous steps taken to fix the problem.</strong> It is much easier to solve a problem when the exact error message or screenshot is provided. If we know what you&rsquo;ve tried so far, we can get to the root cause of the issue more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Consider carefully what you write before you post it.</strong> Once a message is posted, it becomes part of the permanent record of the course and can easily be found by others.</li>
<li><strong>If you are lost, don&rsquo;t know an answer, or don&rsquo;t understand something, speak up!</strong> Email and Canvas both allow you to send a message privately to the instructors, so other students won&rsquo;t see that you asked a question. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions anytime, as you can choose to do so without any fear of being identified by your fellow students.</li>
<li><strong>Class discussions are confidential.</strong> Do not share information from the course with anyone outside of the course without explicit permission.</li>
<li><strong>Do not quote entire message chains; only include the relevant parts.</strong> When replying to a previous message, only quote the relevant lines in your response.</li>
<li><strong>Do not use all caps.</strong> It makes it look like you are shouting. Use appropriate text markup (bold, italics, etc.) to highlight a point if needed.</li>
<li><strong>No feigning surprise.</strong> If someone asks a question, saying things like &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t know that!&rdquo; are not helpful, and only serve to make that person feel bad.</li>
<li><strong>No &ldquo;well-actually&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</strong> If someone makes a statement that is not entirely correct, resist the urge to offer a &ldquo;well, actually&hellip;&rdquo; correction, especially if it is not relevant to the discussion. If you can help solve their problem, feel free to provide correct information, but don&rsquo;t post a correction just for the sake of being correct.</li>
<li><strong>Do not correct someone&rsquo;s grammar or spelling.</strong> Again, it is not helpful, and only serves to make that person feel bad. If there is a genuine mistake that may affect the meaning of the post, please contact the person privately or let the instructors know privately so it can be resolved.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid subtle -isms and microaggressions.</strong> Avoid comments that could make others feel uncomfortable based on their personal identity. See the syllabus section on Diversity and Inclusion above for more information on this topic. If a comment makes you uncomfortable, please contact the instructor.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid sarcasm, flaming, advertisements, lingo, trolling, doxxing, and other bad online habits.</strong> They have no place in an academic environment. Tasteful humor is fine, but sarcasm can be misunderstood.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates by adhering to the 

<a href="https://www.k-state.edu/about/values/community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K-State Principles of Community</a>.</p>


<h3 id="face-coverings">Face Coverings</h3>

<h3 id="academic-freedom-statement">Academic Freedom Statement</h3>
<p>Kansas State University is a community of students, faculty, and staff who work together to discover new knowledge, create new ideas, and share the results of their scholarly inquiry with the wider public. Although new ideas or research results may be controversial or challenge established views, the health and growth of any society requires frank intellectual exchange. Academic freedom protects this type of free exchange and is thus essential to any university&rsquo;s mission.</p>
<p>Moreover, academic freedom supports collaborative work in the pursuit of truth and the dissemination of knowledge in an environment of inquiry, respectful debate, and professionalism. Academic freedom is not limited to the classroom or to scientific and scholarly research, but extends to the life of the university as well as to larger social and political questions. It is the right and responsibility of the university community to engage with such issues.</p>


<h3 id="campus-safety">Campus Safety</h3>

<p>&ldquo;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.&rdquo; - K-State Honor Pledge</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plagiarism is a very serious concern in this course, and something that we do not take lightly. Computer programs and code are especially easy targets for plagiarism due to how easy it is to copy and manipulate code in such a way that it is unrecognizable as the original source but still performs correctly.</p>
<p>At its core, plagiarism is taking someone else&rsquo;s work and passing it off as your own without giving appropriate credit to the original source. As a student at K-State, you are bound by the K-State Honor Code not to accept any unauthorized aid, and this includes plagiarized code.</p>
<p>When it comes to plagiarism in computer code, there is a fine line between using resources appropriately and copying code. In this program, you should strive to avoid plagiarism issues by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not search for or use any complete solutions to projects in this course found online or from fellow students.</li>
<li>Small portions of code may be used or adapted from an online source with proper citation. To cite a piece of code, include a code comment section above it that contains the original source URL and a description of why it was used.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, copying or adapting small pieces of code to perform auxiliary functions in the assignment is permitted. Copying or adapting code that is the general goal of the assignment should be avoided. For example, if the assignment is to create a bubble sort algorithm, you should write the algorithm from scratch yourself since that is the goal of the assignment. If the assignment is to create a program for displaying data that you feel should be sorted, you may choose to adapt an existing sorting algorithm for your needs (or use one from a library).</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t sure about whether it is OK to use an online resource or piece of code in this course, please contact the instructors using the course discussion forums or help email address. You will not get in trouble for asking, and it will help you determine what the best course of action is. Plagiarism can really only occur when you submit the assignment for grading, so you are welcome to ask for clarification or a judgement on whether a particular usage is acceptable at any time before you submit the assignment.</p>
<p>Codio has features that will compare your submissions against those of your fellow students. Any submissions with a high degree of similarity may be subjected to additional scrutiny by the instructors to determine if plagiarism has occurred.</p>
<p>In this course, any violation of the K-State Honor Code will result in a 0 on that assignment and a report made to the K-State Honor Council. A second violation will result in an XF in this course, as well as any additional sanctions imposed by the K-State Honor Council.</p>

<h1>Welcome to Codio</h1>
<p>Welcome to Codio! For this class, we&rsquo;ll be using Codio for most of our work.  You will access Codio via the links provided in your class materials.</p>
<p>Each module will contain Codio tutorials, Codio projects and occasionally a quiz or discussion.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Next</strong> button below, or the <strong>Right Arrow</strong> at the top of this page, to continue to the next guide page in this Codio project.</p>

<h1>Codio Tutorials</h1>
<p>Each module in Canvas will usually contain two Codio tutorial assignments. Some weeks may have more; in any event module content must be accomplished in order.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first tutorial is a programming language agnostic discussion of the concept the module introduces.  Often this tutorial introduces pseudo code, has questions and may contain a Parsons Puzzle. Most of the questions only allow one attempt, however Parsons Puzzles will allow multiple tries.</li>
<li>The second tutorial will contain your language specific implementation of this concept; the syntax (format) and semantics (behavior/meaning) of the specific keywords.  This tutorial may include a programming example as well as a programming exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these Codio tutorials, there will be several pages of content introducing the material for that module. Some of the pages will look just like this one, with text, images, and maybe even a short video to help you learn the material.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see an outline of the pages available as part of this module, click the &ldquo;hamburger&rdquo; menu button at the top-right of the page.</p>
<p>Some of the pages may also include short questions to check for understanding of the material. You&rsquo;ll need to answer these questions as they appear in order to get points for completing the tutorial module. Remember that the tutorials make up part of your grade in this course, so make sure you answer all of the questions in the tutorial module before submitting it. In some cases, you&rsquo;ll be able to resubmit your answers until you get a correct answer, but other questions will not allow that.</p>
<p>In fact, below is a quick example of what one of those questions would be like. Take a moment to answer the question correctly, then continue to the next page of this module.  For those of you unfamiliar with the work of Douglas Adams, the answer is forty-two.</p>

<h1>Codio Examples</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSdBs1LXddE">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>On some pages, the Codio guide may also switch to a different view, shown here, allowing you to work directly with code. On the far left is the <strong>file tree</strong>, which shows all of the files accessible to you for this tutorial. Then, in the middle, you may also see one or more open files as tabs at the top of that panel. Those files are usually the ones that you need to edit to complete the example on this page. You can freely open additional files if needed in that panel, or rearrange the panels as needed. However, whenever you enter this page, it will reset the view back to the default.</p>
<p>In the first programming module of the course, we&rsquo;ll discuss more information about how to use Codio to run any code that you&rsquo;ve created. For now, we&rsquo;ll just use text files to introduce the interface.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve completed the example, most pages will include a section at the bottom that allows you to check your work. Just like the other questions, these assessments will count toward your grade on the tutorial project. See if you can complete the exercise and pass the test below. The answer is Picard.</p>

<h1>Codio Interface</h1>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve seen a few pages in Codio, let&rsquo;s take a minute to discuss some of the features of the Codio user interface. Of course, Codio has some 

<a href="https://docs.codio.com/student" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amazing documentation</a>, so feel free to check that out as you work with Codio.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at the menu items at the top of the page. There are several available to you that are worth mentioning. For starters, you can click the <strong>Codio Icon</strong> at any time to go directly to your Codio dashboard.</p>
<p>Under the <strong>Codio</strong> menu, you can also find options to manage your preferences. Here you can adjust things such as the editor settings and theme. Feel free to adjust the settings to match your personal preferences.</p>
<p>The <strong>Project</strong> menu allows you to work with the currently loaded Codio project. Generally you won&rsquo;t need to access many of these items unless your project stops working. However, they are provided for your use in case you need them.</p>
<p>The <strong>File</strong> menu contains options for manipulating the file tree, such as creating new files, renaming them, saving them, and even downloading and uploading files. As you work on larger projects, you&rsquo;ll be using many of these options to manage the files within your project.</p>
<p>Next, the <strong>Edit</strong> menu gives you access to the <em>Undo</em> and <em>Redo</em> action.</p>
<p>The <strong>Find</strong> menu contains entries for searching documents and performing a find-and-replace operation. Most of those actions should be pretty self-explanatory.</p>
<p>The <strong>View</strong> menu allows you to customize your view in Codio. Here we&rsquo;ll find options for managing panels, open tabs, editor settings, and more. Feel free to make use of these options to arrange your Codio view as you prefer. Also, at the bottom of this menu is a <em>Play Guide</em> option, which is very helpful if you accidentally close the guide and need to reopen it.</p>
<p>Under the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, you&rsquo;ll find an option for accessing the <em>Terminal</em> in your project. The Terminal gives you console access to the box that your project is running on.As you work through the content in this program, we&rsquo;ll slowly introduce the Terminal and some of the tasks it can perform.</p>
<p>The <strong>Education</strong> menu is very important, though it only has a single entry. The <em>Mark as Completed</em> option allows you to indicate that you have completed this Codio project or tutorial. Once you select that option, your work will automatically be graded and your grade will be sent to Canvas. From there, you can access the next project or module in the course.</p>
<p>||| warning</p>
<h1 id="dont-submit-projects-accidentally">Don&rsquo;t Submit Projects Accidentally!</h1>
<p>Be very careful when completing a project! Once you&rsquo;ve marked a project as completed, it will become read-only, and you won&rsquo;t be able to make any additional changes to the project. So, you&rsquo;ll need to make sure you&rsquo;ve finished everything in the project first. If you accidentally mark a project as completed, you may contact the instructors for help. Depending on the situation, they may be able to unlock it for you so you can continue your work. However, unlocking a completed project is entirely at the discretion of the instructor.</p>
<p>|||</p>
<p>Finally, the <strong>Help</strong> menu gives you access to many of the support features in Codio. If you get stuck, you may want to review some of the help options available here. Of course, you can always post a message in the course help forum or email for assistance!  This is for help with Codio, not for help on the lesson content.  In general your first request for help should be through the CC210-Help email.</p>
<p>There are also a few other items in the interface you should be aware of. First, in the <strong>File Tree</strong>, there is a <em>Play</em> icon that can also be used to open the guide for the current project.</p>
<p>In the guide, there are a couple of options available by clicking the gear icon in the upper-right of the page. First, there is an option to <em>Restore Current Files</em>. This option will restore the contents of any currently open files back to the default contents from when you first opened the project. In addition, this menu also contains another way to mark the current project as completed.</p>
<p>That covers most of the major features of the Codio interface that we&rsquo;ll be using in this course. If you have any questions about how to use Codio, feel free to ask your teahers or email for assistance.</p>

<h1>Important Notes</h1>
<h2 id="cc-210-is-4-credit-hours">CC 210 Is 4 Credit Hours</h2>
<p>The University guidance is you should spend 12 hours per week on a 4 credit hour course.  We interpret this to mean twelve 50 minute sessions and assume you spend some time studying and reviewing class materials which is not captured in Codio.  Historically, average students come close to this goal, with some weeks going over and the early weeks being low.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/0a-codio-intro/effort.png" alt="Weekly Effort"></p>
<p>Caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>We assume that when given two weeks for a project, the &ldquo;effort&rdquo; is split equally between both weeks.</li>
<li>Students learn different concepts at different rates &ndash; your effort may vary</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Substantially more effort is required to be successful in CC 210 than in CC 110.</strong></p>
<h2 id="modules-1---5-are-mostly-review">Modules 1 - 5 Are Mostly Review</h2>
<h3 id="non-python-students">Non Python Students</h3>
<p>If you are taking CC 210 in a language other than Python, Modules 1 - 5 will quickly introduce you to the basic control statements and variable types in your selected language.  The concepts will be familiar but the application may be a bit more advanced than that which was covered in CC 110.</p>
<h3 id="python-students">Python Students</h3>
<p>If you are taking CC 210 in Python, Modules 1 - 5 may seem like total review.  However, we introduce syntactical and semantic options that, for simplicity&rsquo;s sake, were omitted from CC 110.</p>
<p><strong>Do not become complacent based on the first 3 weeks of course work. This course will become more difficult quickly.</strong></p>
<h2 id="cc-210-projects-vs-cc-110-homeworks-and-labs">CC 210 Projects vs CC 110 Homeworks and Labs</h2>
<h3 id="cut-and-paste-in-projects-is-forbidden">CUT and PASTE in PROJECTS is Forbidden</h3>
<p>We want you to use the Codio editor for your Projects.  It is deliberately feature poor to emphasize the student&rsquo;s knowledge of the language, not the editor&rsquo;s fancy assistance.  See your syllabus, but in general a project which has materials copied/pasted in may receive a 0.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although cut and paste are permitted in TUTORIALs, plagiarism is not. DO NOT paste in someone else&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h3 id="check-it-buttons-may-not-be-comprehensive">&ldquo;Check-It&rdquo; Buttons may not be Comprehensive</h3>
<p>You must develop and test your projects from the terminal.  In CC 110, the student assessment button ran the same test software that the grader did; thus your score on the &ldquo;Check-it&rdquo; button was a true indication of your Codio grade.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/0a-codio-intro/checkit.png" alt="Check It Output"></p>
<p>In CC 210, the &ldquo;Check-it&rdquo; button may be only a small subset the tests run for your Codio grade, so just because you pass those tests does not mean that your project is complete. This also does not guarantee you will receive a passing grade from the actual grader run after you submit your project. <strong>It is your job to test your code thoroughly in the terminal and develop your own test cases.</strong></p>
<h3 id="all-work-is-subject-to-manual-review">All Work is Subject to Manual review</h3>
<p>Your submitted project may be reviewed manual for structure, forbidden commands, proper function from the terminal, etc.  Please see your syllabus.</p>
<p>As a result your the score you receive from Codio may not reflect your final score. Here is the estimated points workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Autograder assigns a grade in Codio and LMS software (e.g. Canvas).</li>
<li>Manual review may deduct some points &ndash; see syllabus.</li>
<li>Plagiarism detection is run and penalties applied.</li>
<li>Late penalties may be applied.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Completing a Unit</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! We&rsquo;ve completed this unit in Codio, and we are now on the last page.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just one more thing to do: we need to mark the unit as complete. When we do that, Codio will grade our work and then send the grade to Canvas. Once the grade is recorded in Canvas, we&rsquo;ll get access to the next item in the module.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle note">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Take a Breather</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve marked a unit complete in Codio, it may take several minutes for the grading process to complete and for your grade to appear in Canvas. So, if you immediately try to access the next item in the module, you may not have access until Codio has submitted your grade to Canvas.</p>
<p>So, once you&rsquo;ve marked a unit as complete, it&rsquo;s a great time to take a quick breather, leave your computer behind, refill your beverage of choice, and clear your mind while Codio and Canvas handle the grading. By the time you get back, your grade should appear in Canvas and you&rsquo;ll be ready to go.</p>
<p>If your grade doesn&rsquo;t appear in Canvas after several minutes, please send a message to the instructors via your class&rsquo;s help system.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>There are several ways to mark a unit as complete. First and foremost, the last page of the guide in each project should have a &ldquo;Mark as Completed&rdquo; button at the bottom of the page, but these textbook tutorials don&rsquo;t. So, once we see that button, we&rsquo;ll know we&rsquo;ve reached the end of a project.</p>
<p>On the tutorials, we can click the gear icon in the upper-right of the page, and select &ldquo;Mark as Completed&rdquo; there. It should also be available in the tutorials as well.</p>
<p>Finally, we can find a &ldquo;Mark as Completed&rdquo; option on the <strong>Education</strong> menu at the top of the window. Each of these will perform the same function, so we can use any one of them when we are finished with our work.</p>
<p>The 

<a href="https://docs.codio.com/students/courses/complete-assignment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codio Documentation</a> gives several different ways that it can be done.</p>
<p>Of course, don&rsquo;t forget the warning on the previous page - we should make sure we are completely done with the unit before marking it as complete.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s go ahead and mark this unit as complete by clicking the &ldquo;Mark as Completed&rdquo; option found by clicking the gear icon above, or the <strong>Education</strong> menu at the top. Once we do that, we&rsquo;ll be able to complete the final few things in Canvas for this module, and then we can move on to Module 1 - Hello World!</p>

<h1>What is Programming?</h1>
<p>As with any learning adventure, we must begin somewhere. When learning how to write computer programs, one of the best questions to tackle first is &ldquo;what is programming?&rdquo; As it turns out, the answer to that question is key to understanding exactly what it is we are trying to learn.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-computer">A Simple Computer</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En7FDq5XrsA">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>

<a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/01-object-oriented-programming/01-what-is-programming/video/">Video Materials</a></p>
<p>At its core, a computer is simply an electronic device that is capable of following instructions to perform calculations. In computer science theory, there is a special kind of theoretical computer called a <em>Turing Machine</em> that represents the simplest version of a modern computer. It might look something like this, as imagined by an artist:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.turing.wikimedia.png" alt="Turing Machine"><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A Turing Machine consists of an infinitely long tape that can be used to store data, and a small control box that manipulates the tape. The control box knows how to perform a few simple instructions, such as &ldquo;Move Left&rdquo; or &ldquo;Write 0.&rdquo; So, to program a Turing Machine, we must simply tell the control box which instructions to follow, and it can do it. For example, if we want the Turing Machine to write &ldquo;101&rdquo; on the tape, we could write the following program:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write 1</li>
<li>Move Right</li>
<li>Write 0</li>
<li>Move Right</li>
<li>Write 1</li>
<li>Stop</li>
</ol>
<p>Seems simple enough. We won&rsquo;t go into the details here, but computer scientists have been able to prove that <em>any</em> computer program that can run on a real computer could also be performed on a Turing Machine, as long as the Turing Machine has infinite time and an infinitely long tape.</p>
<p>This video shows an example of what a Turing Machine might look like in real life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3keLeMwfHY%3fstart%3d200">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>So, all we really need to learn is how to write programs for a Turing Machine, right?</p>
<h2 id="a-modern-computer">A Modern Computer</h2>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.desktopcomputer.wikimedia.svg" alt="Desktop Computer"><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s unfortunately not that simple. There are two major differences between a Turing Machine and a modern computer that we must deal with. First, a modern computer knows many more instructions than a Turing Machine. To learn how to write programs that a modern computer can understand, we&rsquo;d have to learn an entirely different vocabulary of commands. At the same time, modern computers are very complex systems, so any program we write might not be very efficient at doing what we want.</p>
<p>So, to learn how to write computer programs quickly and easily, we really want to be able to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a vocabulary of commands that are familiar to us</li>
<li>Have those commands turn into programs that run efficiently on a modern computer</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="compilers--interpreters-to-the-rescue">Compilers &amp; Interpreters to the Rescue!</h2>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.gracehopper.wikimedia.jpg" alt="Rear Admiral Grace M. Hopper, USN"><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Developing computer programs was very difficult work in the 1950s, and many of those early programmers were looking for a better way to solve that exact problem. One of these was Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, shown above. Her team was one of the first to develop the idea of writing computer programs using English words, and then using a second program, which they called a <em>compiler</em>, to convert those English words into instructions a computer could understand.</p>
<p>Their compiler made developing computer programs much simpler, since programmers didn&rsquo;t have to learn an entirely new vocabulary to tell the computer what to do. Instead programmers simply had to learn the rules of what a computer could and couldn&rsquo;t understand, and the <em>syntax</em>, or grammar rules, of how the compiler expected the program to be written. These new programming languages that use English words are referred to as <em>high-level languages</em>.</p>
<p>Programmers would now write the <em>source code</em> for the program in a high-level language, and then use a compiler to generate the <em>machine code</em> that the computer would actually run. In addition, since the compiler was a program itself, it could make sure the machine code it generated was as fast and efficient as possible, eliminating lots of hard work programmers would have to perform to tailor each program to fit the hardware it was going to run on.</p>
<p>Today, programming languages such as <em>C</em>, <em>C++</em>, and <em>Java</em> use compilers to convert source code into machine code.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.steverussell.wikimedia.jpg" alt="Steve Russell"><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, other developers such as Steve Russell, shown above, were working on another type of program, called an <em>interpreter</em>, to solve the same problem. An interpreter can read source code and immediately tell the computer what steps to perform, without needing to generate the whole machine code first. This makes it much easier to write and edit programs on the fly, as the interpreter reads the source code directly each time the program runs. Today, programming languages such as <em>PHP</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>, and <em>Python</em> use interpreters to run the source code on a computer.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>So, <em>programming</em> is simply the act of writing computer code in a way that a computer can run it. In most cases today, that means developing the <em>source code</em> for a program in a <em>high-level language</em>, then using either a <em>compiler</em> to generate the <em>machine code</em> for that program, or an <em>interpreter</em> to run the program directly on the computer from the source code. Of course, we can always write machine code by hand, but that is quite a bit more difficult.</p>
<p>In this class, we&rsquo;ll learn how to write source code in one of two common languages, Java and Python. They both have their own unique features, especially since Java is a compiled language and Python is an interpreted language. However, as we saw above with the Turing Machine example, each language can be used to write <em>any</em> computer program. So, the choice of language is really more about personal preference and the unique features of each language than anything else.</p>
<p>This makes sense, because in general we can use both English and Spanish, as well as most other languages today, to express the same thoughts and ideas, even if we may not always have a word with the same meaning in both languages.</p>

    <div class="box-content">
<p>A programming language is a complete tool set to translate instructions written in one set of symbols to instructions written in machine binary code.  Both Java and Python do this by producing an intermediate representation (byte code) then translating that to machine code.  In Java&rsquo;s case this byte code is saved, in Python&rsquo;s it is not.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.1.Translation.png" alt="Simplified View of Computer Execution"></p>
<p>Computer Central Processing Units (CPU) <b>exclusively</b> run machine code.</p>
    </div>
</div>
If you are going to learn to program, you need some idea of how a computer works.  The most basic view of the computer is a bank of memory connected to a Central Processing Unit (CPU). Each byte in memory has its own unique address and an 8-bit value (eight 0s or 1s : 01001101).  This memory is effectively split up into various regions, with  instructions in one region and  data in another.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.1_comp_architecture.png" alt="Simplified View of Computer Architecture"></p>
<p>The CPU has a limited amount of memory (enough to hold a few dozen values) called registers.  It also contains all the circuity to interpret the instructions an perform mathematical and logical operations on the values stored in the registers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Consider the following program, <code>Z = 5 + 7</code>, which instructs the computer add the values of 5 and 7 and save the value into a variable (memory location).  In machine language this many more commands, a simplification might be:</p></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Instruction</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>LVal eax, 0x01A0</td>
<td>Load the value found at memory loc 0x01A0 into reg eax <br>This is where “5” is stored</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>LVal ebx, 0x01A8</td>
<td>Load the value found at memory loc 0x01A8 into reg ebx <br>This is where “7” is stored</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Add eax, ebx</td>
<td>Add the values in registers eax and ebx together and store the result back into eax</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mov eax, 0x01B0</td>
<td>Move the value in register eax to memory location 0x01B0 <br>This is where the variable Z is stored</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Pretty ugly, but this is how the CPU gets its instructions.</p>
<h2 id="estimating-program-state">Estimating Program State</h2>
<p>But from this we can come up with a pretty powerful <strong>abstraction</strong>.  In programing, an abstraction is a simplified model of a complex system, keeping only the most important details to make using the model easy.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.1_program_state.png" alt="Elements of Program State"></p>
<p>Our abstraction will be that a program consists of an ordered list of instructions, a bunch of labeled cubbyholes for data and some pointer that keeps track of which instruction the computer is currently executing.  These things, the list of  instructions, the current instruction and all the values of all the variables are referred to as a program&rsquo;s state.</p>

<h1>The Software Development Lifecycle</h1>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.1_SDC.png" alt="Five Step Software Development Cycle"></p>
<h2 id="requirements-analysis">Requirements Analysis</h2>
<p>Software Development is more than just programming.  It is a disciplined process of converting requirement into finished product.  It consists of five phases, the first of which is requirements analysis.  In requirements analysis you try and describe the problem you are trying to solve and the features you want the solution to have. Throughout CC 210, the exercise or project statement serves as the requirements analysis phase.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>Next comes the design phase.  In design we describe the solution.  In Object-oriented programming this generally consist of designing the classes and the interactions between them which meet the requirements.</p>
<p>A class is a collection of data and the methods (procedures) by which data is accessed and manipulated.  Classes are generally organized around things (the shopping cart from any online store is a classic example) or functions (communication with your computer’s WIFI card is probably handled by a class).  The design of many of CC 210 exercises and projects will be provided to you.</p>
<h2 id="coding-development">Coding (Development)</h2>
<p>Following design is the coding phase, where programs are written to build the design.  This is the emphasis area of CC 210.  Students will code classes, or fragments of classes&ndash;with their associated variables and methods; and test these methods as you write them.</p>
<p>Low level testing is organic to the coding process.  Imagine you were writing the Goldilocks Porridge Temperature Tester, which takes as input a temperature and outputs &ldquo;too hot&rdquo;, &ldquo;too cold&rdquo; or &ldquo;just right&rdquo;.  Better programmers would test their code with a value from each range to make certain the output is correct.  When a program fails a test, it is said to have a &ldquo;bug&rdquo; and the process of finding and fixing bugs is called debugging.</p>
<p>The advantages of testing as you code are</p>
<ol>
<li>that <strong>you</strong> develop the test cases and therefore have a good understanding of what the code is supposed to accomplish and where the problems might be.</li>
<li>Any bugs must have been introduced or revealed by the last bit of code you wrote.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, if you follow a &ldquo;code-a-little-test-a-little&rdquo; approach, you can quickly narrow down the parts of the code which contain the error. If you write too much code before testing any of it, it can be hard to isolate the bugs.</p>
<h2 id="formal-test">Formal Test</h2>
<p>When the coders believe they have a properly working product, the development enters the formal test phase.  Generally, a separate set of developers put the software through its paces and report any bugs they find.  Some of these bugs will be fixed and retested, while others may be left in the code to be addressed at a future date.  When you run the autograder you have effectively entered the formal test phase.</p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>Finally, there is the deployment phase.  This were people and systems start using your code. The analogous activity for CC 210 certifying your module is complete.</p>

<h1>Features of OOP Languages</h1>
<p>We have chosen to approach the computational core from the object-oriented perspective.  Java and Python both support it.  However, it is easier to understand objects (and classes, the name for the code that implements them) after going over a few more fundamental concepts.  Thus, in the first few modules you will be asked to copy some code verbatim, with little explanation.  Alternatively, you may be asked to only write code between certain comment bars, where we have provided the &ldquo;header&rdquo; and &ldquo;footer&rdquo; code necessary to make the program.</p>
<p>Before we begin programming, let&rsquo;s go over some basic terminology and rules for high-level programming languages.</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>First all high programming languages have a syntax, a pattern of words and symbols that correct instructions follow.  When you receive a syntax error, it means the structure of one or more of your instructions does not follow the language&rsquo;s rules.  In a very real sense, this is the grammar that all correct programming lines will follow.</p>
<p>Natural languages also have a grammar, but most natural language listeners can understand improper grammar.  The question &ldquo;Which room is the dog in&rdquo;, containing the dreaded dangling preposition, will almost certainly be correctly interpreted as &ldquo;In which room is the dog&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Programming languages are not like this – the slightest violation of a grammar rule will result in code that most likely will not run.</p>
<h2 id="semantic">Semantic</h2>
<p>Second, all programming instructions have a meaning, called a semantic.  When your program runs but does not do what you thought it would do, this is a semantic error.  Often a semantic error, a bug, occurs when the coder imperfectly understands the effect of the instruction.</p>
<h2 id="initial-vocabulary">Initial Vocabulary</h2>
<p>Finally, all programming languages have &ldquo;parts of speech&rdquo;, by which the languages identify what kind of thing a word (number) is.  Common &ldquo;parts of speech&rdquo; include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>keywords</strong> - a word that has a special meaning. These words tell the program exactly what to do, and we cannot use these words as identifiers.  For example, in both Java and Python the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; is a keyword; you cannot use a keyword for any purpose other than the one(s) intended by the programming language.</li>
<li><strong>literal</strong> – text evaluated as itself, for example numbers (i.e. 6.626) are meant to represent themselves. Similarly, text literals are most often enclosed in double quotation marks (&ldquo;wildcat&rdquo;).  Text literals are most commonly referred to as strings.</li>
<li><strong>identifiers</strong> - any class, method, or variable name is considered an identifier.  Each language will have both rules (syntax) about what can be identifiers and conventions (style guides) about how to construct them.</li>
<li><strong>variable</strong> – a programmer-defined piece of data.  Programmers name their variables with an identifier.</li>
<li><strong>method</strong> - a piece of code that performs an action in our program. Methods are sometimes referred to as functions or subroutines as well, but we&rsquo;ll use the term method.  Programmers name their methods with an identifier.</li>
<li><strong>class</strong> – a collection of variables and the methods used to manipulate that data.  Classes lay at the heart of object-oriented programming and will be the focus of the last third of this course.</li>
<li><strong>symbols</strong> - any non-alphanumeric symbol which has special meaning.  Common ones include the math symbols (+ - / * =), brackets of all forms (() [] {}) and the some not so obvious ones ( .  ,  ;  &quot;  !).</li>
</ul>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle note">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Subroutine, Function, and Method</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Properly, a <strong>subroutine</strong> is a generic term for a named code fragment that does something.  Your programming language may have a subroutine named <code>math.sqrt(x)</code> that calculates the square root of &lsquo;x&rsquo; or one called <code>print (something)</code>  that prints what ever the value of &lsquo;something&rsquo; is to the screen. The <code>print()</code> subroutine may be many lines long, but you gain access to it by calling (using) its name.</p>
<p>The issue is different programming languages use different words to refer to different kinds of subroutines. <strong>Functions</strong> in C may mean a different thing than <strong>functions</strong> in Fortran, Java, Python or mathematics.</p>
<p>We are not going to worry about the details, and will use <strong>method</strong> or occasionally <strong>function</strong> for callable subroutines.</p>

<h1>Structure of an Object-Oriented Program</h1>
<p>An object oriented program contains lots of additional syntax that instructs the compiler or interpreter^[We are going to just use compiler for simplicity&rsquo;s sake] to impose certain conditions when creating the machine- or byte-code.  We will address the details of this syntax after you have learned the necessary background, until then we will just give you the code.</p>
<h2 id="everything-is-in-a-class">Everything Is In a Class</h2>
<p>Classes are the blueprints of objects.  In an object oriented program everything is inside a class definition.  In this class, every file will contain exactly class definition or class-body.</p>

<p>The class-definition is a &ldquo;code-block.&rdquo; Code-blocks signal a boundary to the compiler.  This helps the compiler manage identifier names, memory and other things.</p>
<p>Code-blocks are delimited, or set apart by various symbols.  In Java and pseudo code, this is done with brackets <code>{ code block }</code>.  Spacing is often also used to make the code more readable, everything a block lines up.</p>
<p>In Python each code block is indented to the right; in this class we will use 4-spaces.  When a line ends with a colon, Python expects the next line to be the start of a new code block (and therefore indented).</p>

<p>Pseudo code is typically used to outline the control-flow of a program.  Control-flow refers to the order in which individual statements are executed. The CC courses follow a modified version pseudo code introduced in the AP Computer Science Principles&ndash;Course Exam Description<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.  Pseudo code is intended to be a near English representation of a program.</p>
<h3 id="display">DISPLAY()</h3>
<p>The pseudo code statement <code>DISPLAY(description)</code> does a lot of heavy lifting.  In this context, DISPLAY means visually indicate to the user.  In this course we will run terminal based programs and DISPLAY will typically indicate &ldquo;print to the terminal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, in other contexts <code>DISPLAY</code> could mean send a notification (smart phone), open a pop up (graphical user interface), or even change the speedometer (automotive display controller).</p>

<h1>History of Java</h1>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.j.1.javalogo.wikipedia.svg" alt="Java Logo"><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems starting in the early 1990s as <em>Oak</em>, a new programming language designed to build upon the ideas of C++. Oak would be object-oriented and include a garbage collector, both things that were seen as weak points of the C++ language at that time. In addition, it would be designed to be portable across many different types of devices.</p>
<p>Eventually, the language was renamed to <em>Java</em>, and was originally used develop applications that could run on a website. These Java <em>applets</em> for the web were very popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but most of them have since been replaced by JavaScript code that can run directly in the web browser.</p>

    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Java vs. JavaScript</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>While Java and JavaScript may share a common-sounding name, they are in fact completely unrelated languages. JavaScript was originally named <em>Mocha</em> and then <em>LiveScript</em>, but was rebranded to JavaScript in 1995. That move was widely regarded as a marketing ploy to take advantage of the fact that Java was the most popular new language at the time.</p>
<p>In fact, today JavaScript is just one of many implementations of a language standard known as <em>ECMAScript</em>. However, the name confusion still exists.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Since that time, Java has grown into its own fully-fledged programming language, and has indeed met its goal of being highly portable. Java today can run on most major computer operating systems through the use of the <em>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</em> and <em>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</em>. In addition, the Android mobile operating system uses the Java programming language, and it has been used on many web servers and in consumer electronics.</p>
<p>For software developers, the <em>Java Development Kit (JDK)</em> provides easy access to all of the tools needed to develop programs using the Java language. Once a program is developed, the Java compiler converts the program to <em>Java bytecode</em>, which is similar to machine-code. That Java bytecode can then be run on any compatible platform using the JVM. This allows Java to achieve true portability. The only part of the system that must be specific to the computer&rsquo;s hardware and operating system is the JVM, while Java bytecode can be used on any system with a compatible JVM installed.</p>
<p>Today, the OpenJDK project handles all development of the Java platform, and the language and all supporting code is free and open source.</p>
<p>If none of these features in the history of Java make any sense at this point, that&rsquo;s OK! It&rsquo;s difficult to describe the differences between programming languages without getting technical. However, that is a good thing for us, since nearly every programming language can be used to create the programs we&rsquo;ll be writing in this course. The differences aren&rsquo;t really important at this point!</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered the basics, let&rsquo;s get right down to it and create our first program in Java!</p>

<p>According to tradition, the first computer program that we cover in any language is a simple program called &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; The entire goal of the program is to demonstrate what it takes to create our first program from scratch in the language and get to the point where we can print the message of our choice to the screen. While that sounds very simple, it is actually a pretty big first step toward learning how to write our own programs. Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>

<p>If this is your first-time programming, it can be quite daunting to know where to get started. This guide will walk you through all the steps to create your first program. However, if you have any questions at all, don&rsquo;t be afraid to seek help. It&rsquo;s much easier to answer questions up front when they come up, instead of dealing with them down the road when you are truly lost.</p>
<p>If you are a Kansas State University student, both your syllabus and the course canvas pages will have information on how to requests help, attend office hours, etc.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="some-terminology">Some Terminology</h2>
<p>In any programming language, there is a bit of terminology that we should discuss before diving in. Here are a few terms we&rsquo;ll want to be familiar with at this point:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>keyword</em> - in any programming language, a <em>keyword</em> is a word that has a special meaning. These words tell the program exactly what to do, and we cannot use these words as <em>identifiers</em>. Consult the 

<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Java Language Keywords</a> list to determine which words are keywords in Java.</li>
<li><em>identifier</em> - any class, method, or variable name is considered an <em>identifier</em>.</li>
<li><em>declaration</em> - in a programming language, we use special lines to <em>declare</em> that something exists. In this example, we&rsquo;ll see both a <em>class declaration</em> and a <em>method declaration</em>.</li>
<li><em>body</em> - following a declaration, we typically find the <em>body</em> of the declared item. The body is enclosed by <em>braces</em>.</li>
<li><em>braces</em> - in Java, we use <em>braces</em> or <em>curly braces</em>, denoted by <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>, to enclose blocks of code. We&rsquo;ll use these to enclose both the <em>class body</em> and <em>method body</em>.</li>
</ol>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Declaration vs. Definition</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Formally, a <strong>Declaration</strong> associates an identifier with a program language element.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Pet</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span> <span style="color:#75715e">// a declaration

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Some older languages (notably C) allowed things to be declared and used before they were defined.   However, Java does not support this style of coding.  As a result, Java documentation and developers tend to use &ldquo;declaration&rdquo; for both declaration and definition.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="open-a-file">Open a File</h2>
<p>To begin, there should see a file named <code>HelloWorld.java</code> open in the panel to the left. If not, click on that file in the file tree to the far left to open it. Make sure that file is open for this example, since the file name must match in order for this process to work properly.</p>
<p>Also, we should make sure that the file is completely empty before moving on. If there is any text currently in that file, take the time to delete it now.</p>
<p>We can also do these same steps on a computer with the Java Development Kit installed. Simply create a new, blank text file named <code>HelloWorld.java</code>.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-class">Create a Class</h2>
<p>Java is an <em>object-oriented</em> programming language. We&rsquo;ll discuss this more in detail in a later module, but for now we&rsquo;ll just need to know that Java requires all of our code to be placed in a <code>class</code>. So, at the very top of our file, we&rsquo;ll enter the following line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">HelloWorld</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That line called a <em>class declaration</em> in Java. Let&rsquo;s break that line down and discuss what each part means:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>public</code> - this keyword is used to identify that the item after it should be publicly accessible to all other parts of the program. In a later module, we&rsquo;ll talk about these keywords, called <em>access modifiers</em>, and the impact they have on our programs. For now, we&rsquo;ll just use <code>public</code> whenever we need an access modifier, such as in a class declaration.</li>
<li><code>class</code> - this keyword says that we are declaring a new class.</li>
<li><code>HelloWorld</code> - this is an identifier that gives us the name of the class we are declaring. Java requires that the class name matches the filename that it is stored in, so we must store the <code>HelloWorld</code> class in a file named <code>HelloWorld.java</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every Java program must contain at least one class declaration. In fact, each Java file we create will contain at least on class declaration, so we&rsquo;ll see this structure repeated very often.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle note">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Too Much Information?</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Unfortunately, when learning to program in Java, there are a few things that we&rsquo;ll just have to take for granted for now until we learn a bit more about how they actually work. Class declarations are a great example of this. For the next several modules, we&rsquo;ll just have to include a class declaration at the top of each file without understanding everything about them. As long as we make sure the identifier matches the name of the file, it should work just fine. In fact, in most of the later examples in this book, we&rsquo;ll have some sample code in each file that includes the class declaration.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re covering it in detail here just to make sure it is clear what is going on at first. It&rsquo;s always better to have too much information than not enough.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="class-body">Class Body</h2>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve completed our class declaration, we need to move on to the <em>class body</em>. The class body is where all of the information about the class is stored. In Java, we use <em>braces</em> to enclose a block of code, such as a body. So, let&rsquo;s modify our file to look like the following example by adding an <em>opening brace</em> <code>{</code> and a <em>closing brace</em> <code>}</code> with a few empty lines in between. Instead of copy-pasting it, try to type it in yourself and see what happens!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">HelloWorld</span> <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Did you notice how the editor in Codio automatically added a closing brace right after you typed the opening brace? That&rsquo;s the power of using a text editor that is tailored for programming. It should have also indented all of the lines between the two braces a bit, making it easier to read your code as we continue to fill it in. It may seem a bit jarring a first, but you&rsquo;ll quickly get used to it. We&rsquo;ll see it happen again later in this example.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Style Guide</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>To make your code easier to read, many textbooks and companies use a <em>style guide</em> that defines some of the formating rules that you should follow in your source code. However, this is a point of contention, and many folks disagree over what is the best format. These formatting rules do not affect the actual code itself, only how easy it is to read.</p>
<p>For this book, most of the examples will be presented in a variant of the 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#K&amp;R_style" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K&amp;R Style</a> used by most Java developers, which places the opening brace on the same line as the declaration, but the closing brace is placed on a line by itself and indented at the same level as the declaration. The code inside will be indented by four spaces.</p>
<p>Google provides a comprehensive 

<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">style guide</a> that is recommended reading if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about how to format your source code.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="main-method">Main Method</h2>
<p>Inside of our class body, we must create a main method. A <em>method</em> is a piece of code that performs an action in our program. Methods are sometimes referred to as <em>functions</em> or <em>subroutines</em> as well, but we&rsquo;ll use the term <em>method</em>. Each Java program have one class that contains at least one special method, called the <em>main method</em>, that tells the program where to start. So, let&rsquo;s modify our file to the left to look like this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">HelloWorld</span> <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">static</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>String<span style="color:#f92672">[]</span> args<span style="color:#f92672">){</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We just added a <em>method declaration</em> and <em>method body</em> to our program! Let&rsquo;s look at some of the keywords we used here:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>public</code> - just like before, we are using the <code>public</code> access modifier to allow any part of our program to access this method.</li>
<li><code>static</code> - the <code>static</code> keyword is one of the more difficult to understand, and even some experienced programmers struggle with it. In this example, we must use <code>static</code> since this is the main method, which must always be a static method. This is because we aren&rsquo;t using this method inside of an object, which we&rsquo;ll cover in a much later module. For now, every method we create will use a <code>static</code> keyword.</li>
<li><code>void</code> - this describes what kind of data this method should output. Since this is the main method, it cannot output anything to another part of the program, so we use the special <code>void</code> keyword to denote the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t output anything. (At least, it doesn&rsquo;t output anything to the rest of the program, but it may display things on the screen!)</li>
<li><code>main</code> - this is another identifier that gives the name of the method. Since our program needs to have at least one main method, we need to use <code>main</code> as the name of this method.</li>
<li><code>(String[] args)</code> - following the method name is a section in parentheses that defines the inputs, or <em>parameters</em>, for the method. The main method must take in one parameter, an array of Strings. By convention, we use the identifier <code>args</code> as the name of that parameter. We&rsquo;ll learn more about parameters, Strings, and arrays, in a later module. For now, we&rsquo;ll just have to remember that the main method must have this exact set of parameters.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly, we included a second set of braces to enclose the method body. Notice how everything in the class body is indented slightly, making it easy to see the structure of the code.</p>
<p>For now, we&rsquo;ll just have to memorize the fact that the main method in Java is declared using <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>. As we move through this book, we&rsquo;ll slowly learn more about each part of that line and what it does, and it will make much more sense.</p>
<h2 id="saying-hello">Saying Hello</h2>
<p>Finally, we can write our code. The actual code of our program goes inside the main method&rsquo;s body, between the two braces. In the classic &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; example, we simply want to print the words &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; to the screen. So, let&rsquo;s modify our program one last time to look like this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">HelloWorld</span><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">static</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>String<span style="color:#f92672">[]</span> args<span style="color:#f92672">){</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello World&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you typed in that information, you might have noticed that Codio also added a second set of quotation marks <code>&quot;</code>, just like it did with the braces earlier. This is another example of a programmer-friendly text editor at work!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review what we just added to our program:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>System.out.println</code> - this line tells us that we&rsquo;d like to use a method called <code>println</code> in the <code>System.out</code> 

<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PrintStream</a> object. Again, that means very little to us right now, but for now we&rsquo;ll need to know to use this method to print a line of text to the screen. Following the name of the method is a set of parentheses that accepts input to the method, which is what we&rsquo;d like to have printed to the screen.</li>
<li><code>&quot;Hello World&quot;</code> - by putting this in the parentheses after <code>System.out.println</code>, we are telling the <code>println</code> method in <code>System.out</code> to print <code>Hello World</code> to the screen. We have to enclose it in quotation marks <code>&quot;</code> so that our program will treat it as a line of text and not more Java code. The values, or variables passed to a method are referred to as the method&rsquo;s <em>parameters</em>.</li>
<li><code>;</code> - each line of code in Java must end with a semicolon <code>;</code>. This helps the compiler determine where one line of code ends and another begins. They really serve the same purpose as the period <code>.</code> in written English. However, periods are already used for other purposes in Java, so the semicolon became the standard symbol for the end of each line of code.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s all it takes to write our first program in Java. On the next page, we&rsquo;ll learn how to actually compile and run this program using Codio.</p>

<p style="color:red; font-sze:150%">Note: the video's "Run" menu reference is obsolete.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve written our first Java program, we must compile and run the program to see the fruits of our labors. There are many different ways to do this using the Codio platform. We&rsquo;ll discuss each of them in detail here.</p>
<h2 id="terminal">Terminal</h2>
<p>Codio includes a built-in Linux terminal, which allows us to perform actions directly on a command-line interface just like we would on an actual computer running Linux. We can access the Terminal in many ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Selecting the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, then choosing the <strong>Terminal</strong> option</li>
<li>Pressing SHIFT + ALT + T in any Codio window (you can customize this shortcut in your Codio user preferences)</li>
<li>Pressing the <strong>Open Terminal</strong> icon in the file tree</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, some pages may already open a terminal window for us in the left-hand pane, as this page so helpfully does. As we can see, we&rsquo;re never very far away from a terminal.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the terminal window and navigate to our program. When we first open the Terminal window, it should show us a prompt that looks somewhat like this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.j.3.terminal1.png" alt="Initial Terminal View"></p>
<p>There is quite a bit of information there, but we&rsquo;re interested in the last little bit of the last line, where it says <code>~/workspace</code>. That is the current directory, or folder, our terminal is looking at, also known as our <em>working directory</em>. We can always find the full location of our working directory by typing the <code>pwd</code> command, short for &ldquo;Print Working Directory,&rdquo; in the terminal. Let&rsquo;s try it now!</p>
<p>Enter this command in the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>pwd
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and we should see output similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.j.3.pwd.png" alt="pwd Command Output"></p>
<p>In that output, we&rsquo;ll see that the full path to our working directory is <code>/home/codio/workspace</code>. This is the default location for all of our content in Codio, and its where everything shown in the file tree to the far left is stored. When working in Codio, we&rsquo;ll always want to store our work in this directory.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s use the <code>ls</code> command, short for &ldquo;LiSt,&rdquo; to see a list of all of the items in that directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>~/workspace<span style="color:#e6db74">$</span> ls
</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>java  README.md
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We should see a short list of items appear in the terminal.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>cd</code> command, short for &ldquo;Change Directory,&rdquo; to change the working directory. To change to the <code>java</code> directory, type <code>cd</code> into the terminal window, followed by the name of that directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>~/workspace<span style="color:#e6db74">$</span> cd java
</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>~/workspace/java<span style="color:#e6db74">$</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We are now in the <code>java</code> directory, as we can see by observing the <code>~/workspace/java</code> on the current line in the terminal. Finally, we can do the <code>ls</code> command again to see the files in that directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>~/workspace/java<span style="color:#e6db74">$</span> ls
</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>HelloWorld.java
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We should see our <code>HelloWorld.java</code> file! If it doesn&rsquo;t appear, try using this command to get to the correct directory: <code>cd /home/codio/workspace/java</code>.</p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;re at the point where we can see the <code>HelloWorld.java</code> file, we can move on to actually compiling and running the program.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-in-terminal">Compiling in Terminal</h2>
<p>To compile a Java program in the terminal, we&rsquo;ll use the <code>javac</code> command, short for <em>Java Compiler</em>, followed by the name of the Java file we&rsquo;d like to compile. So, in our case, we&rsquo;ll do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>javac HelloWorld.java
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If it works correctly, we shouldn&rsquo;t get any additional output. The compiler will look through our Java file and create a new file containing the Java bytecode for our program, called <code>HelloWorld.class</code>. We can use the <code>ls</code> command to see it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>ls
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.j.3.javac.png" alt="javac Command Output"></p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Problems?</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>If the <code>javac</code> command gives you any output, or doesn&rsquo;t create a <code>HelloWorld.class</code> file, that most likely means that your code has an error in it. Go back to the previous page and double-check that the contents of <code>HelloWorld.java</code> exactly match what is shown at the bottom of the page. You can also read the error message output by <code>javac</code> to determine what might be going wrong in your file.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll cover information about simple debugging steps on the next page as well. If you get stuck, now is a great time request help via your course&rsquo;s help system. You aren&rsquo;t in this alone!</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="running-in-terminal">Running in Terminal</h2>
<p>Finally, we can now run our program! Once it is compiled, just type the following in the terminal to run it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>java HelloWorld
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.j.3.java.png" alt="java Command Output"></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it! We&rsquo;ve now successfully compiled and run our first Java program. Of course, we can run the program as many times as we want by repeating the previous <code>java</code> command. If we make changes to the <code>HelloWorld.java</code> file, we&rsquo;ll need to recompile it using the previous <code>javac</code> command first. Then, if those changes instruct the computer to do something different, we should see those changes when we run the program after compiling it.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle tip">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Try It!</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>See if you can change the <code>HelloWorld.java</code> file to print out a different message. Once you&rsquo;ve changed it, use the <code>javac</code> and <code>java</code> commands to compile and run the updated program. Make sure you see the correct output!</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="codio-assessments">Codio Assessments</h2>
<p>Last, but not least, many of the Codio tutorials and projects in this program will include assessments that we must solve by writing code. Codio can then automatically run the program and check for specific things, such as the correct output, in order to give us a grade. For most of these questions, we&rsquo;ll be able to make changes to our code as many times as we&rsquo;d like to get the correct answer. Try the example below!</p>

<p>Of course, when developing a computer program, there are always times when things don&rsquo;t quite work the way we&rsquo;d like them to. Let&rsquo;s review a few of the common errors and how to solve them.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-issues">Compiler Issues</h2>
<p>The Java Compiler is usually the source of most of our woes when first learning how to write programs in Java. The compiler expects the source code to be correctly formatted, or else it won&rsquo;t be able to generate the Java bytecode for our program. Let&rsquo;s modify our <code>HelloWorld.java</code> file to include some errors, just to see exactly what the error messages from the compiler are like.</p>
<h3 id="missing-braces">Missing Braces</h3>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s replace everything in <code>HelloWorld.java</code> with the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">HelloWorld</span><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">static</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>String<span style="color:#f92672">[]</span> args<span style="color:#f92672">){</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello World&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div>
  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Spot the Error</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Before compiling that program, can you spot the error? Being able to find errors in code without using a compiler will definitely help you develop programs much faster. It is just like being able to spell words correctly without using a spell-checker. It makes everything go just a bit more smoothly.</p>
<p>In each of the examples in this section, take a minute and see if you can spot the error before running it through the compiler. The quiz in this module includes a few questions that require you to spot the error in a piece of code, so this is great practice for later!</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve updated that file, we can compile it using the using the terminal. When we do, we should see output similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.j.4.missingbrace.png" alt="Java Missing Closing Brace"></p>
<p>That error message gives us quite a bit of information. The first part, <code>java/HelloWorld.java</code> tells us which file the error is in, which is handy later on when we start working in programs that include multiple source code files. Following that, we see a <code>7</code> after the file name, which tells us that the error is on or around line 7. However, that doesn&rsquo;t always mean that we&rsquo;ll need to edit something at line 7 to fix the error; it just means that the Java Compiler realized there was an error when it reached line 7. Sometimes, we must make a change elsewhere in the file to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>After that, we&rsquo;ll see the actual error message, which in this case is <code>error: reached end of file while parsing</code>. That may not seem very helpful at first, but it actually gives us an important clue.</p>
<p>If we look at the code above, we&rsquo;ll notice that it is missing the second closing brace <code>}</code> at the end of the file. So, the compiler was expecting to see one more closing brace, but didn&rsquo;t find it. So, to fix that, we&rsquo;ll just need to add one more closing brace at the end of the file, and it should work just fine.</p>
<h3 id="missing-semicolon">Missing Semicolon</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example we can try:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">HelloWorld</span><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">static</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>String<span style="color:#f92672">[]</span> args<span style="color:#f92672">){</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello World&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we try to compile this file, we should get output similar to the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.j.4.missingsemicolon.png" alt="Java Missing Semicolon"></p>
<p>In this example, the output is really helpful. It clearly shows us exactly where in our code we forgot to include a semicolon. By adding that symbol where indicated, we can solve the problem.</p>
<h2 id="runtime-issues">Runtime Issues</h2>
<p>Of course, there are some problems that the compiler may not catch. These are known as <em>runtime errors</em>, since they happen at the <em>time</em> we <em>run</em> our programs. They can be especially tricky to deal with, but thankfully they are usually quite rare.</p>
<h3 id="incorrect-main-method">Incorrect Main Method</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at one more example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">HelloWorld</span><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">static</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>String args<span style="color:#f92672">){</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello World&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This time, the program actually compiles! However, when we try to actually run the file, we&rsquo;ll get an error similar to this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.j.4.mainmethod.png" alt="Java Incorrect Main Method"></p>
<p>This is because we accidentally forgot the square brackets <code>[]</code> in the main method declaration. It should be <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>, as the error message so helpfully tells us. So, it is important to remember that our programs may still have errors, even if the compiler doesn&rsquo;t find any.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle note">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Break Stuff</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve learned a bit about how to debug compiler errors, let&rsquo;s see if you can figure out how to cause one! Modify <code>HelloWorld.java</code> in a way that causes the compiler to output the following error message:</p>
<p><code>error: class WrongClass is public, should be declared in a file named WrongClass.java</code></p>

<h1>History of Python</h1>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.p.1.pythonlogo.wikimedia.svg" alt="Python Logo"><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Python was originally developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language used at the research lab where he worked. Some initial goals of this language were to be able to interface with the Amoeba operating system and to include functions for exception handling.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Guido &amp; Monty</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>According to the official Python FAQ, Python was named in honor of <em>Monty Python&rsquo;s Flying Circus</em>, as Guido van Rossum was reading scripts from the TV show while he was originally implementing parts of Python. He needed a &ldquo;short, unique, and slightly mysterious&rdquo; name, so it stuck.</p>
<p>The Python community for years referred to van Rossum as &ldquo;Benevolent Dictator for Life&rdquo; (BDFL) to denote his place as lead developer, a role from which he stepped down in 2018.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Several initial versions of Python were released throughout the 1990s, but a major update came with the release of Python 2.0 in 2000. Much of the existing Python code base is written for Python 2.X. However, the Python Software Foundation stopped supporting Python 2.X in December 2019.</p>
<p>Python 3, was released in 2008, is the current supported version.  It includes several structural changes to the language that made it incompatible with earlier versions. There are some automated tools available to translate Python 2 code to Python 3.</p>
<p>Python is a multi-paradigm approach. It includes features from object-oriented programming, functional programming, and more.</p>
<p>In this course, we&rsquo;ll deal exclusively with Python 3. As such, we&rsquo;ll need to be careful to use the correct Python 3 documentation and interpreter, or else we may have issues. We&rsquo;ll discuss this a bit more fully later in this module.</p>
<p>If none of these features in the history of Python make any sense at this point, that&rsquo;s OK! It&rsquo;s difficult to describe the differences between programming languages without getting technical. However, that is a good thing for us, since nearly every programming language can be used to create the programs we&rsquo;ll be writing in this course. The differences aren&rsquo;t really important at this point!</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered the basics, let&rsquo;s get right down to it and create our first program in Python!</p>

<p>According to tradition, the first computer program that we cover in any language is a simple program called &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; The entire goal of the program is to demonstrate what it takes to create our first program from scratch in the language, and get to the point where we can print the message of our choice to the screen. While that sounds very simple, it is actually a pretty big first step toward learning how to write our own programs. Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>

<h2 id="some-terminology">Some Terminology</h2>
<p>In any programming language, there is a bit of terminology that we should discuss before diving in. Here are a few terms we&rsquo;ll want to be familiar with at this point:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>keyword</em> - in any programming language, a <em>keyword</em> is a word that has a special meaning. These words tell the program exactly what to do, and we cannot use these words as <em>identifiers</em>. Consult the

<h2 id="open-a-file">Open a File</h2>
<p>To begin, there should see a file named <code>HelloWorld.py</code> open in the panel to the left. If not, click on that file in the file tree to the far left to open it. Make sure that file is open for this example, since the file name must match in order for this process to work properly.</p>
<p>Also, we should make sure that the file is completely empty before moving on. If there is any text currently in that file, take the time to delete it now.</p>
<p>We can also do these same steps on a computer with Python installed. Simply create a new, blank text file named <code>HelloWorld.py</code>.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Lets take a quick look at the starter code.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td style="white-space: nowrap"><code>class HelloWorld:</code></td> <td>starts the class definition.  By convention, class names in Python follow PascalCase, each "word", including the first is capitalized and spaces are omitted.  Also by convention, the file name and class name are the same.</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="white-space: nowrap"><code>  @staticmethod<br/>    def main(args):</code></td><td><code>def main()</code> starts the definition of the main method.  Python convention is that method names (function names) are in camelCase.  Object oriented convention is that the <code>main()</code> method is static (more on this about module 10).</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="white-space: nowrap"><code>      # WRITE YOUR CODE HERE</code></td><td>Through module 5, you will just be adding code to the <code>main()</code> method.  These comments are a guide to help you get the code in the right place.  There is no connection between the number of blank lines and the number of lines of code you will need to write.</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="white-space: nowrap"><code>if __name__ == ...</code></td><td>By convention, object oriented programs start in the main method, this code accomplishes that.</td></tr>
</table>
<h2 id="saying-hello">Saying Hello</h2>
<p>Finally, we can write our code. The remaining code of our program goes right inside the definition of <code>main()</code> . In the classic &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; example, we simply want to print the words &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; to the screen. So, let&rsquo;s add the following code to that file. To fully see how this example works, we should manually type the code into the file instead of copying and pasting it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello World!&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Did you notice how the editor in Codio automatically added a closing parenthesis right after you typed the opening parenthesis? That&rsquo;s the power of using a text editor that is tailored for programming. It should have also done the same for the quotation marks. It may seem a bit jarring a first, but you&rsquo;ll quickly get used to it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review what we just added to our program:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>print</code> - this line tells us that we&rsquo;d like to use a method called <code>print()</code>, which is a built-in method in Python. That means very little to us right now, but for now we&rsquo;ll need to know to use this method to print a line of text to the screen. Following the name of the method is a set of parentheses that accepts input to the method, which is what we&rsquo;d like to have printed to the screen.</li>
<li><code>&quot;Hello World&quot;</code> - by putting this in the parentheses after <code>print</code>, we are telling the <code>print()</code> method to print the litteral value <code>Hello World</code> to the screen. We have to enclose it in quotation marks <code>&quot;</code> so that our program will treat it as a line of text and not more Python code.</li>
</ol>

<p>To make your code easier to read, many textbooks and companies use a <em>style guide</em> that defines some of the formating rules that you should follow in your source code. In Python, these rules are very important, as the structure of your code is defined by the layout. We&rsquo;ll learn more about that in a later module.</p>
<p>For this book, most of the examples will be presented using the guidelines in the 

<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Style Guide for Python</a>. However, by default Codio used to use 4 spaces for an indentation level instead of 2, so that is the format that will be used in some examples in this book.</p>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve written our first Python program, we must run the program to see the fruits of our labors.</p>
<h2 id="terminal">Terminal</h2>
<p>Codio includes a built-in Linux terminal, which allows us to perform actions directly on a command-line interface. We can access the Terminal in many ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Selecting the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, then choosing the <strong>Terminal</strong> option</li>
<li>Pressing SHIFT + ALT + T in any Codio window (you can customize this shortcut in your Codio user preferences)</li>
<li>Pressing the <strong>Open Terminal</strong> icon in the file tree</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, some pages may already open a terminal window for us in the left-hand pane, as this page so helpfully does. As we can see, we&rsquo;re never very far away from a terminal.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">

<p>No worries! We&rsquo;ll give you everything you need to know to run your Python programs in this course.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn a bit more about the Linux terminal and some of the basic commands, feel free to check out this great video on YouTube:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuRxtrO2Ag">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p style ="color:red">Note: CC-210 requires no  more Linux knowledge than CC-110.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the terminal window and navigate to our program. When we first open the Terminal window, it should show us a prompt that looks somewhat like this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.j.3.terminal1.png" alt="Initial Terminal View"></p>
<p>There is quite a bit of information there, but we&rsquo;re interested in the last little bit of the last line, where it says <code>~/workspace</code>. That is the current directory, or folder, our terminal is looking at, also known as our <em>working directory</em>. We can always find the full location of our working directory by typing the <code>pwd</code> command, short for &ldquo;Print Working Directory,&rdquo; in the terminal. Let&rsquo;s try it now!</p>
<p>Enter this command in the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>pwd
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and we should see output similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.j.3.pwd.png" alt="pwd Command Output"></p>
<p>In that output, we&rsquo;ll see that the full path to our working directory is <code>/home/codio/workspace</code>. This is the default location for all of our content in Codio, and it&rsquo;s where everything shown in the file tree to the far left is stored. When working in Codio, we&rsquo;ll always want to store our work in this directory.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s use the <code>ls</code> command, short for &ldquo;LiSt,&rdquo; to see a list of all of the items in that directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>ls
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.j.3.ls.png" alt="ls Command Output"></p>
<p>We should see a whole list of items appear in the terminal. Most of them are directories containing examples for the chapters this textbook, including the <code>HelloWorld.py</code> file that we edited in the last page. Thankfully, the directories are named in a very logical way, making it easy for us to find what we need. For example, to find the directory for Python examples, look for the directory named <code>python</code> in the output.</p>
<p>Finally, we can use the <code>cd</code> command, short for &ldquo;Change Directory,&rdquo; to change the working directory. To change to the <code>python</code> directory, type <code>cd</code> into the terminal window, followed by the name of that directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>cd python
</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>:~/workspace<span style="color:#e6db74">$</span> cd python
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>~<span style="color:#f92672">/</span>workspace<span style="color:#f92672">/</span>python<span style="color:#e6db74">$</span> 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We are now in the <code>python</code> directory, as we can see by observing the <code>~/workspace/python</code> on the current line in the terminal. Finally, we can do the <code>ls</code> command again to see the files in that directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>ls
</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>~/workspace/python<span style="color:#e6db74">$</span> ls
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>HelloWorld.py
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We should see our <code>HelloWorld.py</code> file! If it doesn&rsquo;t appear, try using this command to get to the correct directory: <code>cd /home/codio/workspace/python</code>.</p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;re at the point where we can see the <code>HelloWorld.py</code> file, we can move on to actually running the program.</p>
<h2 id="running-in-terminal">Running in Terminal</h2>
<p>To run it, we just need to type the following in the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>python3 HelloWorld.py
</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>~/workspace/python<span style="color:#e6db74">$</span> python HelloWorld.py
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Hello World<span style="color:#f92672">!</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it! We&rsquo;ve now successfully run our first Python program. Of course, we can run the program as many times as we want by repeating the previous <code>python3</code> command. If we make changes to the HelloWorld.py file that instruct the computer to do something different, we should see those changes the next time we run the file..</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Problems?</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>If the <code>python3</code> command doesn&rsquo;t give you any output, or gives you an error message, that most likely means that your code has an error in it. Go back to the previous page and double-check that the contents of <code>HelloWorld.py</code> exactly match what is shown at the bottom of the page. You can also read the error message output by <code>python3</code> to determine what might be going wrong in your file.</p>
<p>Also, make sure you use the <code>python3</code> command and not just <code>python</code>. The <code>python3</code> command references the newer Python 3 interpreter, while the <code>python</code> command is used for the older Python 2 interpreter. In this book, we&rsquo;ll be using Python 3, so you&rsquo;ll need to always make sure you use <code>python3</code> when you run your code.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll cover information about simple debugging steps on the next page as well. If you get stuck, now is a great time to go to you can use the course discussion forums or email list to ask for assistance. You aren&rsquo;t in this alone!</p>

<h2 id="codio-assessments">Codio Assessments</h2>
<p>Last, but not least, many of the Codio tutorials and projects in this program will include assessments that we must solve by writing code. Codio can then automatically run the program and check for specific things, such as the correct output, in order to give us a grade. For most of these questions, we&rsquo;ll be able to make changes to our code as many times as we&rsquo;d like to get the correct answer. Try the example below!</p>

<h1>Debugging</h1>

<!-- TODO Redo Video -->

<p>Of course, when developing a computer program, there are always times when things don&rsquo;t quite work the way we&rsquo;d like them to. Let&rsquo;s review a few of the common errors and how to solve them.</p>
<h2 id="wrong-interpreter">Wrong Interpreter</h2>
<p>When working with Python, one of the most common mistakes is typing the <code>python</code> command when we actually mean to use the <code>python3</code> command. This would cause our program to be interpreted with the Python 2 interpreter instead of the Python 3 interpreter. Those versions of Python are not fully compatible, so we might see some strange errors.</p>
<p>For example, if we write our <code>HelloWorld.py</code> file using syntax for Python 2, and try to run it using the Python 3 interpreter, we may see an error similar to this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.p.4.syntax.png" alt="Python Syntax Error"></p>
<p>We might run into similar problems if we ran code written for Python 3 in the Python 2 interpreter.</p>
<h2 id="syntax-issues">Syntax Issues</h2>
<p>One of the easiest errors to run into when learning how to program is forgetting a syntax element. To see how that works, let&rsquo;s replace the code in our <code>HelloWorld.py</code> file with the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello World&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div>
  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Spot the Error</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Before running that program, can you spot the error? Being able to find errors in code without using an interpreter will definitely help you develop programs much faster. It is just like being able to spell words correctly without using a spell-checker. It makes everything go just a bit more smoothly.</p>
<p>In each of the examples in this section, take a minute and see if you can spot the error before running it through the interpreter. The quiz in this module includes a few questions that require you to spot the error in a piece of code, so this is great practice for later!</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve updated that file, we can run it using the method of our choice, either using the terminal or the options in the <strong>Run Menu</strong>. When we do, we should see output similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.p.4.missingparen.png" alt="Python Missing Closing Parenthesis"></p>
<p>That error message gives us quite a bit of information. The first part, <code>File &quot;1p-hello/HelloWorld.py&quot;</code> tells us which file the error is in, which is handy later on when we start working in programs that include multiple source code files. Following that, we see a <code>line 2</code> after the file name, which tells us that the error is on or around line 2. However, that doesn&rsquo;t always mean that we&rsquo;ll need to edit something at line 2 to fix the error; it just means that the Python Interpreter realized there was an error when it reached line 2. Sometimes, we must make a change elsewhere in the file to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>After that, we&rsquo;ll see the actual error message, which in this case is <code>SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing</code>. In this message, <code>EOF</code> refers to the end of the file. That may not seem very helpful at first, but it actually gives us an important clue.</p>
<p>If we look at the code above, we&rsquo;ll notice that it is missing the closing parenthesis <code>)</code> at the end of the line of code. So, the interpreter was expecting to see a closing parenthesis, but didn&rsquo;t find it. So, to fix that, we&rsquo;ll just need to add a closing parenthesis at the end of that line of code, and it should work just fine.</p>
<p>We would see a similar error if we left off an ending quotation mark <code>&quot;</code> as well.</p>
<h2 id="incorrect-function">Incorrect Function</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example we can try:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>pint(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello World&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we try to run this file, we should get output similar to the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.p.4.badfunction.png" alt="Python Incorrect Function"></p>
<p>In this example, the output is really helpful. It clearly shows us exactly where in our code our error is, and we can see that the error is <code>NameError: name 'pint' is not defined</code>. If we look closely at the line indicated in the error message, we should see that we simply misspelled the name of the <code>print()</code> method, which can easily be corrected.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle tip">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Break Stuff</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve learned a bit about how to debug interpreter errors, let&rsquo;s see if you can figure out how to cause one! Modify <code>HelloWorld.py</code> in a way that causes the interpreter to output the following error message:</p>
<p><code>SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'</code></p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now written our first program in a real, high-level programming language. While the program may only consist of a few lines of code at most, it is still a very big step toward writing bigger and more advanced programs.</p>
<p>Computer technology has some quite a long way since the 1950s, but the same needs that drove the development of compilers and interpreters continue today to drive the development of more advanced programming languages and related tools. It&rsquo;s a very exciting field to experience firsthand, and once we understand a bit of code, we&rsquo;ll be able to see it for ourselves.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we&rsquo;ll dive in head first to learn all about how to store and manipulate various types of data in our programs.</p>
<p>Now that we are done with this unit, we can mark it as completed. The 

<a href="https://docs.codio.com/students/courses/complete-assignment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codio Documentation</a> gives instructions for how to do that. The easiest way is to either click the <strong>Education</strong> menu and select <strong>Mark as Completed</strong>, or by clicking the <strong>Gear Icon</strong> at the top of this panel and selecting <strong>Mark as Completed</strong>.</p>

<p>Everything in the world can be represented using data. Think about that for a minute. Does it make sense?</p>
<p>Picture a tree. That tree can be described by its width, height, age, number of leaves, and even its color or texture. What about a person? A person has a name, age, height, and many other attributes. Could we simply represent trees, humans, and other entities in our computer programs using their attributes?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the next big step in learning how to write a computer program: dealing with data. Many of the programs we&rsquo;ll write are simply built to help us manipulate data in some fashion. Think back to the Turing Machine example from the first chapter. All a Turing Machine does is manipulate data on a tape, and it is capable of running any possible computer program.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll learn all about the different ways we can work with data in our programs.</p>

<h1>Variables</h1>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about variables. A <em>variable</em> is a placeholder for another value in a computer program. Most students first learn about variables in a mathematics course, such as Algebra. For example, in math, we might see the equation 
<span class="math align-center">$ x + 5 = 10 $</span>, where 
<span class="math align-center">$ x $</span> is a variable, or placeholder, for a value. Using the algebraic rules, we can solve that equation to find that 
<span class="math align-center">$ x = 5 $</span>.</p>
<p>Variables in a computer program share some similarities with variables in math, but have some differences as well. First, variables in a computer program are also placeholders that represent a value. However, in programming, instead of representing an <em>unknown</em> value, variables in a computer program represent a <em>stored</em> value, one which we can always access.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/2.2.cardboardbox.png" alt="Cardboard Box Labelled Height"><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>One way to think about variables in a computer program is to imagine them as a cardboard box. When we <em>declare</em> a variable, we are making a new box and giving it a name, which is the <em>identifier</em> of the variable. In the picture above, we&rsquo;ve declared a variable named <code>height</code>.</p>
<p>Then, we can store a value in that variable, using a statement such as <code>height = 42</code>, which will put the number 42 inside of the <code>height</code> variable. This is an <em>assignment</em> statement, which we&rsquo;ll cover in detail in this chapter.</p>
<p>Later in our program, we can then access the value stored in that variable and use it for calculations or output. For example, if we have additional variables named <code>width</code> and <code>area</code>, and have already stored the value 10 in <code>width</code> using <code>width = 10</code>, we can calculate the area of rectangular object using a statement such as <code>area = width * height</code>. This would use the current values in the <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> variables, and then store the result in the variable named <code>area</code>.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, each time we declare a variable, we are telling the computer to set aside a small piece of memory in which to store something. We give the variable a name when we declare it, and then we can use that name to store or retrieve data from the location in memory our computer gave us.</p>
<p>Using variables effectively is a essential to writing good computer programs. This chapter will introduce many of the concepts related to dealing with variables and data in our code.</p>

<h1>Basic Data Types</h1>
<p>In a computer, all data, even the instructions, is stored in a <em>binary</em> format. Binary data consist entirely of 1s and 0s, or, in the case of a computer, it could be represented as &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;off&rdquo; for current in a circuit, or &ldquo;positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;negative&rdquo; charges stored on a magnetic storage device. It could even be &ldquo;open&rdquo; and &ldquo;closed&rdquo; for physical memory gates. There are many different ways to represent it, but it all boils down to just 1s and 0s.</p>
<p>Of course, we need a way to convert between the binary 1s and 0s that a computer understands and the actual data we&rsquo;d like to represent. On this page, we&rsquo;ll cover some of the common types of data and how they are handled by most computer programming languages.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle note">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Binary</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Working with binary data can be a complex topic. In this program, we won&rsquo;t deal directly with binary data very often. If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the binary numerical system and how it works, check out the Wikipedia article on 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binary Numbers</a>.</p>
<p>You may also want to review the 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_types_of_numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">List of Types of Numbers</a> article as well, since we&rsquo;ll refer to several of those types.</p>
<p>Binary literals are  often prepended with <code>0b</code>  thus <code>10</code> represents the decimal number 10, whereas <code>0b10</code> represents the binary number 10 and the decimal number 2. Recall that a literal represents the actual typed value.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="common-numerical-data">Common Numerical data</h2>
<p>Numbers, and thus numerical literals, are used everywhere in computer programs.  This goes beyond obvious arithmetic and accounting applications.  Modern graphics, artificial intelligence and simulation programs use numerical representations of data to quickly perform their operations.  Thus, it is unsurprising that there are many ways to write and store numeric data.</p>
<h3 id="integers">Integers</h3>
<p>The first type of data we&rsquo;ll deal with in our computer program is <em>whole numbers</em>. These are numbers such as 1, 0, -1, 25, -186, 12852, and more. In both mathematics and programming, we refer to these numbers as <em>integers</em>. An <em>integer</em> is any whole number, or a real number without a fraction or decimal component. We sometimes refer to these numbers as <em>counting numbers</em>.</p>
<p>To store these numbers in our computer program, we typically use a <em>signed integer</em> data type. This data type allows us to store both positive and negative numbers in binary in our computer&rsquo;s memory. We won&rsquo;t go too far into the details of how that works in this course, but there is more information on how that works on 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a></p>
<h3 id="floating-point">Floating Point</h3>
<p>Next, we&rsquo;ll also need to handle numbers that include a fraction or decimal component. These include <em>rational numbers</em> such as 1.5, -2.98, 3 1/3, and even <em>irrational numbers</em> such as 
<span class="math align-center">$ e $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ \pi $</span>.</p>
<p>Our computer uses a special representation known as <em>floating point</em> to store these numbers. Floating point is very similar to <em>scientific notation</em>, where a number such as 1,230,000 is represented as 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1.23 * 10^{6} $</span>. In this example, 1.23 is the <em>significand</em> and 6 is the <em>exponent</em> of the number. It is known as floating point because the decimal point &ldquo;floats around&rdquo; the number based on the exponent. We could represent the same number as 
<span class="math align-center">$ 12.3 * 10^{5} $</span> or 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0.123 * 10^{7} $</span> just by adjusting the exponent, causing the decimal point to move within the significand.</p>
<p>Modern computers use the 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IEEE 754</a> standard for encoding floating-point numbers into binary. Again, we won&rsquo;t go into the specifics here, but the graphic below gives us a good idea of how a floating point number can be broken up and stored in binary.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/2.3.double.wikimedia.svg" alt="Double Precision Floating Point"><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Here we can see that a 64 bit space in memory is divided into three parts, one for the sign (to denote either a positive or negative number), another for the exponent, and a third for the fraction or significand of the number.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Floating Points are Approximations</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Just like there are rational numbers (such as 1/3) which cannot be exactly represented in the base 10 decimal number system, there are numbers which cannot be exactly exactly represented in base 2 (the underlying binary system used by you computer).  In fact, there are many more rational numbers that cannot be exactly represented by binary numbers (hence floats) than there are in a base 10 system.</p>
<p>In addition to this, because floats have a finite (set) number of bits, there is a limit to the number of significant bits you can count on (typically 16 for a 64-bit float).  This is generally only a concern in scientific computing (where you deal with either very big or very small numbers).  However, many programs use common graphic processing units, which use only 32-bits (7 significant digits) to speed up calculations.  This much lower accuracy can cause problems with statistical simulations.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="boolean">Boolean</h2>
<p><em>Boolean</em> values, named for 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Boole</a> represent <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> in a computer program. While it may be as simple as storing a single bit, with 0 and 1 representing <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, most programming languages provide a special way to deal with these values as they are very important in our computer programs. We&rsquo;ll spend most of the next several chapters discussing how to work with Boolean values, but for now they are just another type of data our program could store.</p>
<h2 id="text-as-data">Text as Data</h2>
<h3 id="character">Character</h3>
<p>Many high-level programming languages have a character data type. A <em>character</em> represents a single letter in a written language such as English. Most programming languages use a special code called 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASCII</a>, or the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It defines a numerical value for each character in the English language, as well as several special characters such as the newline or <code>\n</code> character we&rsquo;ve already seen. Below is a table showing the entire ASCII code.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/2.3.ascii.wikimedia.svg" alt="ASCII Table"><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>So, to store the character <code>c</code>, our computer would store the number 99 in binary. We should also notice that the capital and lowercase letters are separate, so <code>C</code> is 67.</p>
<p>Modern computer programming languages also support the use of Unicode characters. We won&rsquo;t cover that in this course, but it is important to remember later on when working with languages other than English.</p>
<h3 id="string">String</h3>
<p>Sometimes we want to store entire sentences in our computer programs. A sentence is just a <em>String</em> of characters, object-oriented languages use a string class for this purpose and we&rsquo;ll cover everything we need to know about strings in a later chapter.</p>

<h1>Data Types Under the Hood</h1>
<p>A variable in a high level language is just a memory address.  It tells the compiler/interpreter where to start looking for the binary string of data.</p>
<h3 id="decoding-the-binary">Decoding the binary</h3>
<p>All high-level programming languages use a type system to tell the system <em>how</em> to decode the binary data it finds there.  All types have a size and a semantic, how many bits to grab and how to interpret each bit. Consider the 2-byte (16-bit) binary sequence <code>1100 0110 1110 0100</code>, it can be interpreted as many values based on its type.</p>

<h3 id="performing-operations">Performing Operations</h3>
<p>Operations and methods are only defined for specific types: you can divide two integers, but not two characters;  integer division works differently than floating point division (more on this later in this chapter).  It is up to the programmer to select the appropriate type for a variable and keep track of it.</p>
<h3 id="implications-for-object-oriented-programming-oop">Implications for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h3>
<p>All objects are created from a class definition.  An object made from the class definition, <code>class Cat ...</code> would be a variable of type Cat. A key part of OOP is that objects modify their own data. So, understanding what types your variables are is vital to understanding program state, which allows you to verify correct behavior and troubleshoot buggy code.</p>
<h2 id="typing-systems">Typing Systems</h2>
<h3 id="explicit-static-ie-java">Explicit Static (i.e. Java)</h3>
<p>One typing system, often used by compiled languages, is the explicit static type system.  In this scheme the programmer explicitly tells the compiler the type of each variable when the is declared or defined.  The statement <code>uint16 x = 5;</code> tells the compiler that:</p>
<ol>
<li>it should reserve a memory address for a 16-bit variable (the size of unint16)</li>
<li>that the programmer is going to use the alias &lsquo;x&rsquo; for that memory address</li>
<li>it should always interpret the 16-bits of &lsquo;x&rsquo; as an unsigned integer</li>
<li>it should put the binary string which, when evaluated as a <code>uint16</code> is equal to the decimal number 5 into the reserved memory address</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="implicit-dynamic-ie-python">Implicit Dynamic (i.e. Python)</h3>
<p>Another typing system, often used by interpreted languages, is the implicit dynamic system.  In this system, the interpreter infers (guesses) the type of the variable based on the literal or variable in the definition. The statement <code>x = 5</code> tells the interpreter:</p>
<ol>
<li>to infer a type based on the literal &ldquo;5&rdquo;</li>
<li>to reserve a memory address for the inferred type</li>
<li>that the programmer is going to use the alias &lsquo;x&rsquo; for that memory address</li>
<li>to put the binary string which, when evaluated as the inferred type is equal to the decimal number 5 into the reserved memory address</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="converting-between-types">Converting Between Types</h2>
<p>High-level languages typically have operations or methods to convert from one data type to another.</p>
<p>For example, in Java, to print a line to the terminal (the <code>System.out</code> object), one uses its <code>println()</code> method.  This method takes as a parameter a literal or variable of type String.</p>
<p>If you have integer, and you want to print it to the terminal, you can use the Integer class&rsquo;s <code>tostring()</code> method which takes as a parameter an int and provides (returns) the text equivalent.</p>

Line 3 prints out <code>xString</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly Python&rsquo;s built in <code>print()</code> method also takes a parameter of type String.</p>

<p>When a programmer explicitly tells the computer to convert one variable Type to another, the process is called <em>casting</em>.</p>
<p>However, both languages will accept their version of the following</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>     x &lt;- 5
     DISPLAY (x)
</code></pre><p>through a process call <em>coercion</em>.</p>
<p>In most modern high-level languages, when a method is supplied the wrong type of parameter the language checks to see if there is an automatic conversion from the supplied type to the required type. If so the language first converts the offending parameter, then calls the method.  The same procedure is used for operators.  Depending of coercion for simple types is a common practice.  Depending on it for more complex types or programmer developed classes can be perilous.</p>
<p>In practice, prefer casting over coercion.  Casting ensures the program does exactly what you want.</p>
<h3 id="pseudo-code-for-variable-assignment">Pseudo Code for Variable Assignment</h3>
<p>The above code is an example of pseudo code. It is not an actual programming language, but rather an outlining language with an informal syntax. The focus is on what to do, not how to do it. A programmer might first write the pseudo code for a stretch of code, ensure it makes sense, then code it up in the proper implementation language.  Together with flowcharting, pseudo code is one of the modeling techniques you might use to &ldquo;mock up&rdquo; your program during the code phase of the software development cycle.  The two tools are complementary, with some concepts more clearly expressed as flowcharts and others as pseudo code.</p>
<p>Generically</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>identifier</em> &larr; <em>expression</em></p>
is the syntax for variable assignment.
<p>Where</p>
<ul>
<li>identifier is the programmer selected name of the variable</li>
<li>expression is the &ldquo;ultimate value&rdquo; of the right hand side
<ul>
<li>y &lt;- 7     # 7 is evaluated to be the number seven</li>
<li>x &lt;- y + 3 # first y gets evaluated to 7, then 3 is evaluated to 3, the addition is evaluated to be the number ten</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Pseudo code typically ignore type.  The consumer of the pseudo code is expected to figure out the language (implementation) details.</p>

<h1>Arithmetic</h1>
<p>Once we have data stored in our programs, there are a number of ways we can manipulate that data. Let&rsquo;s look at a few of them here.</p>
<h2 id="basic-operations">Basic Operations</h2>
<p>At its core, a computer is capable of performing all of the basic arithmetic operations, so we can write programs that can <em>add</em>, <em>subtract</em>, <em>multiply</em> and <em>divide</em> numbers. However, there is one big caveat that must be dealt with.</p>
<p>As discussed on the previous page, computer programs can store numbers as both integers and floating point numbers. What happens when we perform operations on two different types of numbers? For example, if an integer is added to a floating point number, would the resulting number be an integer or a floating point number, as in 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 + 1.5 $</span>?</p>
<p>As our intuition suggests, performing the operation gives us 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 $</span>, which is a floating point number. <strong>In general</strong>, when performing an operation on either two integers or two floating point numbers, the result will match the type of the two operands. However, when performing an operation on both an integer and a floating point number, the result is a floating point number.</p>
<p>There are two notable exceptions to this rule:</p>
<ol>
<li>In a strongly-typed programming language, such as Java, the result may be converted to match the type of the variable it is being stored in, if allowed by the language.</li>
<li>When dividing two integers, the result may be either a floating point number or an integer, depending on the language.</li>
</ol>
<p>We&rsquo;ll discuss both of these exceptions later in this chapter when we dig into the details for each programming language.</p>
<h2 id="new-operations">New Operations</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn262DJeOaE">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>

<a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/02-data-types-math/05-arithmetic/video/">Video Materials</a></p>
<p>In addition to the basic operations listed above that we are all familiar with from our mathematics class, there are a few new operations we should be aware of as well.</p>
<h3 id="modulo">Modulo</h3>
<p>The first new operation, the <em>modulo operation</em>, finds the remainder after dividing two numbers. It is typically written as 
<span class="math align-center">$ 9 \bmod 5 $</span> when printed, but most programming languages use the percent sign <code>%</code>, as in <code>9 % 5</code> to refer to this operation.</p>
<p>To calculate the result of the modulo operation, we must look back to long division. In the example above, we can calculate 
<span class="math align-center">$ 9 \bmod 5 $</span> by first calculating 
<span class="math align-center">$ 9 / 5 $</span>, which is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> with a remainder of 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>. So, the result of 
<span class="math align-center">$ 9 \bmod 5 $</span> is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>.</p>
<p>Another way to think about the modulo operation is to simply find the largest multiple of the second operand that is smaller than the first, and then subtract the two, just like you do when performing long division. So, we can find 
<span class="math align-center">$ 42 \bmod 13 $</span> by first calculating the largest multiple of 
<span class="math align-center">$ 13 $</span> that is smaller than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 42 $</span>, which is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 39 $</span>, or 
<span class="math align-center">$ 13 * 3 $</span>. Then, we can subtract 
<span class="math align-center">$ 42 - 39 = 3 $</span>, so 
<span class="math align-center">$ 42 \bmod 13 = 3 $</span>.</p>
<p>The modulo operation is very important in many areas of programming. In fact, it is one of the core operations for most modern forms of encryption!</p>

Therefore, each programming language may return a slightly different result when performing this operation on a negative number. Make sure you carefully consider how this operation is used, and consult the official documentation for your programming language or test the operation if you aren&rsquo;t sure how it will work.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h3 id="truncated--floor-division">Truncated &amp; Floor Division</h3>
<p>As discussed a bit earlier, one of the stranger things in programming is dealing with division. When dividing two integers, it is possible to end up with a result that is a floating point number, as in 
<span class="math align-center">$ 9 / 8 = 1.125 $</span>. So, how should we handle this?</p>
<p>It turns out that each programming language may handle it a bit differently. For example, Java would <em>truncate</em> the result by removing everything after the decimal point to make the result an integer. So, in Java, the statements <code>99 / 100</code> and <code>-99 / 100</code> would both usually evaluate to <code>0</code>. However, we can force the result to be a floating point number by making sure that at least one of the operands is a floating point number, as well as the variable we are storing the result in.</p>
<p>Python, on the other hand, would store the result as a floating point number by default if needed. However, Python also includes a special operator, known as <em>floor division</em> or <code>//</code>, that would round the result down. For positive numbers, this means that the result would be rounded <em>toward</em> 0, while negative numbers would be rounded <em>away from</em> 0. So, in Python, the statement <code>99 // 100</code> would evaluate to <code>0</code> since it is rounded toward 0, while <code>-99 // 100</code> would evaluate to <code>-1</code> since it is rounded away from 0.</p>
<p>In short, we just need to pay special attention when we use the division operation to make sure we get the result we expect.</p>
<h3 id="assignment--equality">Assignment &amp; Equality</h3>
<p>Lastly, we should briefly discuss the assignment operator. We&rsquo;ve already come across it earlier in this chapter. In mathematics, we usually use the equals sign <code>=</code> to denote <em>equality</em>, as in 
<span class="math align-center">$ x + 5 = 10 $</span>.</p>
<p>In programming, we use the single equals sign <code>=</code> to perform <em>assignment</em>. This allows us to store a value into a variable, as in <code>x = 5</code>. This would store the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> into the variable <code>x</code>. We could also say that we <em>assign</em> the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> to x.</p>
<p>However, it is very important to note that the variable we are assigning a value to goes first, on the left side of the equals sign. So, we cannot say <code>5 = x</code> in most programming languages.</p>

<h1>More on Operations</h1>
<h1 id="operation">Operation</h1>
<p>Computer Science, thus programming, has its roots in Mathematics and uses a lot math technical jargon.  Unfortunately this means you need to be familiar with some of this jargon.</p>
<p>An operation is a fancy math term for &ldquo;do something&rdquo;, but carries with it its own set of vocabulary. An operation is composed of:</p>
<ol>
<li>an operator (one or more symbols)</li>
<li>operands (one or more pieces of data)</li>
<li>a semantic meaning (i.e. what the operator does)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="binary-operations">Binary Operations</h2>
<p>Binary operations operate on two inputs. This class of operations should be familiar from arithmetic.  Its format is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>    operand1 operator operand2
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        2     +        4
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        x     +        y
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>where the operator is typically some type of symbol.</p>
<p>Operator symbols are typically overloaded in programming languages; they do different things based on the types of the operands.  For example, a typical language might do the following base on the plus sign.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type Operand 1</th>
<th>Type Operand 2</th>
<th>Result Type</th>

<tr>
<td>int <br> 2</td>
<td>int <br> 4</td>
<td>int <br> 6</td>

<tr>
<td>int <br> 2</td>
<td>float <br> 4.0</td>
<td>float <br> 6.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>float <br> 1.1</td>
<td>float <br> 3.7</td>
<td>float <br> 4.8</td>

<td>int <br> 4</td>
<td><strong>Error</strong> operation not defined for an operand of type String and int</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You must refer to your language&rsquo;s documentation for how each operator functions. Operator behavior, particularly in the presence of mixed-type operands varies from language to language.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Infix vs. Prefix</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>The form <code>operand1 operator operand2</code> is called infix notation.  However, there is another construct called prefix, that looks like <code>operator operand1 operand2</code> or <code>  + 2 4</code>.  For technical reasons it is easier to write programming languages that use prefix notation.  In OOP, you may see prefix notations used for methods and classes which were adapted from a functional programming language where prefix notation is more common.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="unary-operations">Unary Operations</h2>
<p>There are some operations that have just one operand, these are called unary operations.  The typical form is <code> operator operand</code> or <code> operand operator</code>.  A fairly common unary operator is <code>!</code> for the logical operation &ldquo;not&rdquo;.  <code>!True</code> is the same as <code>False</code>, more on this in the chapter on Boolean Logic.</p>

<h1>User Input in CC 210</h1>
<p>Most programs process some type of user input, whether through typed in text, mouse clicks or cut &amp; paste.  In this class we are going to allow 3 types of user input:</p>
<ol>
<li>Through command-line arguments</li>
<li>Through a file stream</li>
<li>Through the keyboard stream</li>
</ol>
<p>We are going to give the code that accesses the input right away, and will discuss nuances of the input type in more depth as we get to appropriate parts of the course.</p>

    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="command-line-arguments">Command Line Arguments</h2>
<p>Today, this command line arguments are most often options for the program to follow at launch.  The <code>chrome</code> shortcut on my desktop actually just runs the console command
<code>&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe&quot;</code>.
But I could modify it to
<code>&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe&quot; --incognito</code>,
and chrome would launch in incognito mode. The <code>--incognito</code> is a command line argument.</p>
<p>In this class, the command line we use typically consists of a launching program  (the command) and the name of the program to run. It can also have data which can be passed to the program.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ &lt;command&gt; &lt;program&gt; &lt;argument1&gt; &lt;argument2&gt; ...

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>7
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>$  python3 Add.py 2 5
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>7
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In both cases the program <code>Add</code> would run, and would be passed the strings: &ldquo;2&rdquo; and &ldquo;5&rdquo;.  How this is coded will be covered in a few chapters, for now you just need to know how to pass arguments into you program.</p>
<h3 id="common-properties-of-command-line-arguments">Common Properties of Command Line Arguments</h3>
<p>There are some common properties of command line arguments you need to know.</p>
<ol>
<li>Arguments are passed in as strings. Programmers must convert them to the appropriate data types.</li>
<li>Arguments are passed in order from left to right.  If your problem specification asks for a positive number then a negative number, you must provide them in that order. <code>java Program 2 -7</code> would be correct, <code>java Program -7 2</code> would be wrong.</li>
<li>Arguments are separated by one or more spaces.</li>
<li>There are ways for a program to tell how many arguments there are.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it.  User input can be provided on the command line in the form of string arguments (values).  When the command is run, these arguments are packed up by the operating system and given to the program.  When command line arguments are required (or optional), the problem statement will tell you their order and purpose.  The decision on whether or not to use command line arguments is typically a design consideration.</p>
<h2 id="streams">Streams</h2>
<p>Both file and keyboard input are handled as streams.  Streams are a computer science abstraction for data that is organized in a queue.  Data (usually bytes) are ordered and read from front to back.  You can see how this works for the keyboard.  When we type &ldquo;dog&rdquo; the keyboard stream (called stdin for &ldquo;standard input&rdquo;) receives the bytes [100, 111, 103].  Files from a disk drive are similarly read first byte to last.</p>
<h3 id="streams-as-objects">Streams as Objects</h3>
<p>Object oriented high level programming like Java and Python have built in classes that read values from a stream.  Thus, with some minor set up differences, the commands to  read from a file are typically exactly same  the commands to read from the keyboard.  This is the power of abstraction &ndash; the details of how to read from these different streams are hidden from the programmer who only wants read them.</p>
<p>Streams are literally bytes of data. We will use methods that interpret those byes as text, and then convert the text to the type of variable we need.</p>

<h1>Types</h1>
<p>The Java programming language is a <em>explicit statically typed</em> language. This means that each and every variable we use in our programs must be <em>declared</em> with a name and a type before we can use it. The Java compiler can then perform a step known as <em>type checking</em>, which verifies that we are using the proper data types in our program.</p>
<p>The major advantage of this approach is that many errors in our computer programs can be discovered by the compiler, well before we ever try to run the program directly. It can also help us determine what the cause of the error is by stating that it is a <em>type error</em>, giving us a clue toward how it could be solved.</p>
<p>One downside to this approach is that it makes our programs a bit more complex, as we must think ahead about what types of data we&rsquo;ll be storing in each variable, and we&rsquo;ll need to write our programs carefully to avoid type errors. However, it may also make our programs easier to manage later on, as we&rsquo;ll know exactly what type of data is stored in each variable at any given point in the program&rsquo;s execution.</p>
<p>To make dealing with types a bit easier, Java will automatically coerce data from a &ldquo;narrower&rdquo; data type to a &ldquo;wider&rdquo; data type without any additional code. For example, an integer in Java can be stored in a floating point variable.</p>
<p>However, the opposite case is not true. In Java, we cannot store a floating point number in an integer without explicitly converting the data type. We&rsquo;ll see how to do that later in this chapter.</p>

<h1>Numbers</h1>
<p>Most of the computer programs we&rsquo;ll write must deal with numbers in some way. So, it makes perfect sense to start working with the numerical data types, since we&rsquo;ll use them very often. Let&rsquo;s dive in and see how we can use these numerical data types in Java!</p>
<p>Java has built in primitive types for various numeric, text and logic values.  A variable in Java can refer to either a primitive type or a full fledged object.</p>
<h2 id="integers">Integers</h2>
<p>The first data types we&rsquo;ll learn about in Java are the ones for storing whole numbers. There are actually 4 different types that can perform this task, each with different characteristics.</p>

<span class="math align-center">$ 2^{63} - 1 $</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As we can see, each data type in this list has a different size, and can store numbers within a different range. So, if we know the minimum and maximum values that could possibly be stored in a particular variable, we can use the smallest corresponding data type that can store that value. This would allow us to conserve the amount of memory used in our programs.</p>
<p>However, in practice, most modern computers have more than enough memory available to handle our programs, so this is typically not a concern for most developers. Instead, it is best to use the largest possible data type, to avoid errors in the future as the program is updated and data values may become larger than initially anticipated.</p>
<p>In this program, and most of the code in this book, we&rsquo;ll typically use the integer, or <code>int</code> data type for all whole numbers. Even though it isn&rsquo;t the largest data type for storing whole numbers, it is generally large enough. In addition, the <code>int</code> data type is supported universally across many different programming languages, so learning how to use it will make it easier to switch between languages later on.</p>
<h2 id="floating-points">Floating Points</h2>
<p>The next data types we&rsquo;ll learn about in Java are the ones for storing rational and irrational numbers. There are actually 2 different types that can perform this task, each with different characteristics.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Unlike the data types for whole numbers, it is more difficult to discuss the minimum and maximum values for these data types, as it requires a thorough understanding of how they are stored in binary and interpreted by the processor in a computer. In general, each one can handle large numbers as well as small numbers extremely well.</p>
<p>However, just like scientific notation, the numbers it stores at best can only be as accurate as the number of digits it holds. So, when storing an extremely large number, there will be some rounding error.</p>
<p>In this program, and most of the code in this book, we&rsquo;ll typically use the Double, or <code>double</code> data type for all decimal numbers.</p>
<h2 id="using-numbers-in-code">Using Numbers in Code</h2>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve discussed the various data types available in Java, let&rsquo;s look at how we can actually create variables that can store data in our programs.</p>

<p>Before working with the code examples in the rest of this chapter, you&rsquo;ll need to add a <strong>class declaration</strong> and a <strong>main method declaration</strong> to the <code>Types.java</code> file that is open to the left. If you don&rsquo;t recall how to do that, now is a great time to review the material in Chapter 1 before continuing.</p>
<p>Setting up a new file each time is great programming practice!</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h3 id="declaring">Declaring</h3>
<p>In Java, we can <em>declare</em> a variable using this syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;type&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So, to declare a variable of type <code>int</code> named <code>x</code>, we would write:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can also do the same for each of the types listed above:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">byte</span> b<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As with any other part of our program, we must first <em>declare</em> it before we can use it.</p>

<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/variables.html%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Java Documentation</a>.</p>
<p>By convention, variable names should be descriptive and use camelCase to aid in reading.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h3 id="assigning">Assigning</h3>
<p>Once a variable has been declared, we can give it a value using an assignment statement. Assignment uses this syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;destination&gt; = &lt;expression&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In that example above, <code>&lt;destination&gt;</code> is the identifier of the variable we&rsquo;d like to store data in, and <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> is any valid Java expression that produces a value. It could be a number, another variable, a mathematical operation, or even a method call, which we&rsquo;ll learn about in a later chapter. The variable we are storing the value in must always be on the left side of the equals <code>=</code> sign.</p>
<p>For example, if we want to store the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> in an <code>int</code> variable named <code>x</code>, we could write the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 5<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can even combine the declaration and assignment statements into a single statement, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 5<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The same syntax applies to all of these types in Java:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">byte</span> b <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 1<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When assigning values from one variable to another using primitive data types, the value is <em>copied</em> in memory. So, changing the value of the first variable would not affect the others, as in this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 5<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>At the end of that code, the value of <code>x</code> is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span>, but <code>y</code> still contains 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span>. This is important to remember.</p>

    <div class="box-content">
<p>See if you can create a variable using each of the six data types listed above in <code>Types.java</code>. What happens when you assign a value at that is too big or too small for the variable&rsquo;s data type? Can you assign the value from an <code>int</code> variable into a <code>byte</code> variable?</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h3 id="printing">Printing</h3>
<p>We can also use the <code>System.out.println</code> and <code>System.out.print</code> methods we learned earlier to output the current value of a variable to the screen. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 5<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that the variable <code>x</code> is not in quotation marks. This way, we&rsquo;ll be able to print the <em>value</em> stored in the variable <code>x</code> to the screen. If we place it in quotation marks, we&rsquo;ll just print the letter <code>x</code> instead.</p>
<p>Later, in the project for this chapter, we&rsquo;ll learn how to combine multiple variables into a single output.</p>
<h3 id="casting">Casting</h3>
<p>When writing our programs, sometimes we need to change the data type that a particular value is stored as, especially when we want to store it in a new variable. Ideally, we would construct our programs to avoid this issue, but in the real world we aren&rsquo;t always so lucky.</p>
<p>To change the data type of a value, we can <em>cast</em> that value to a different data type. To cast a value to a different data type, we put the data type we&rsquo;d like it to be in parentheses in front of the value.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the example below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 120<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">byte</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>y<span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we&rsquo;ve created an <code>int</code> variable <code>x</code>, and stored 
<span class="math align-center">$ 120 $</span> in that variable. We then create a <code>byte</code> variable <code>y</code>, and try to store the value from <code>x</code> into <code>y</code>.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle tip">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Follow Along</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Try to run these examples by placing each one in <code>Types.java</code> and seeing what happens. Does it work? Try it before reading the answers below.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>When we try to compile that example, we should get the following compiler error:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/image_1.png" alt="Incompatible Types Error"></p>
<p>Since the <code>int</code> data type is larger than the <code>byte</code> data type, the compiler will give us an error stating that we might lose data when we perform that conversion. Of course, if we reverse the <code>int</code> and <code>byte</code> data types, and try to assign a <code>byte</code> to and <code>int</code>, it will work just fine.</p>
<p>In general, we should try to avoid this problem by redesigning our program to eliminate the need to store a variable in a smaller type, but sometimes it is necessary. Do do this, we&rsquo;ll need to <em>cast</em> the value to the correct data type. Let&rsquo;s update the example above:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 120<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>y<span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we have added a <code>(byte)</code> in front of the variable <code>x</code> when we are assigning it to <code>y</code>. This tells the compiler that we would like to convert the data type of <code>x</code> to <code>byte</code> before storing it in <code>y</code>. Now, when we try to compile and run this program, it will act as we expect.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/image_2.png" alt="Successful Type Cast"></p>
<p>However, let&rsquo;s look at one final example to see why the compiler would warn us about converting to a smaller data type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 128<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div>
  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Cast vs. Convert</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>When we say &ldquo;cast&rdquo; we really mean <strong>convert</strong>.  Sometimes this results in a change in the the binary representation.   Conversion preserves the semantics (meaning) but over writes the binary.  In addition to the &ldquo;casting&rdquo; syntax <code>(desired type) value ... (int)2.0</code>, you will be exposed to many <code>ConvertTo()</code> methods later in this course.</p>
<p><strong>Casting</strong> nearly always preserves the original binary but may result in gibberish; you lose the meaning.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;2&#39;</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span>

</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// int value of 00110010 is 50
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, &ldquo;casting&rdquo; is nearly always used to mean &ldquo;convert&rdquo;.  It comes from the origins of programming, where languages supported fewer types and the binary had the same semantic meaning across multiple data types.</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>type</th><th>bytes</th><th>binary for the value of 2</th></tr>
    <tr><td>byte</td><td>1</td><td>00000010<td></tr>
    <tr><td>short</td><td>2</td><td>0000000000000010<td></tr>
    <tr><td>int</td><td>4</td><td>00000000000000000000000000000010<td></tr>
</table>
<p>From the above table you can see how casting might work for various sized integer values. Leading &ldquo;bits&rdquo; were ignored when casting to a byte-wise smaller type.  Leading 0s were added when casting to larger type.</p>
<p>We will use cast and convert interchangeably in this course to mean convert to the desired data type.  In Java casting between primitive numeric-types often preserves the semantics (value) of the cast. <code>(int) 2.5</code> is the integer <code>2</code>, and <code>(double)-4</code> is the double <code>-4.0</code>.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>In this example, instead of storing 
<span class="math align-center">$ 120 $</span> in <code>x</code>, we have instead stored 
<span class="math align-center">$ 128 $</span>. When we compile and run this program, we get this unexpected output:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/image_3.png" alt="Overflow Error"></p>
<p>We expect it to output 
<span class="math align-center">$ 128 $</span>, but instead it outputs 
<span class="math align-center">$ -128 $</span>. That&rsquo;s strange, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening is an error known as <em>integer overflow</em>. Since 
<span class="math align-center">$ 128 $</span> is too large to fit in a <code>byte</code> variable, the computer will <em>truncate</em>, or remove, the bits that are at the front of the number that won&rsquo;t fit. This could cause data to be lost or misinterpreted, which is what happens here.</p>
<p>So, we must always be careful and not try to cast a variable to a smaller data type if it is too large to fit in that data type. This is why the compiler will always warn us when we try to do so, unless we add an explicit cast to our code.</p>

    <div class="box-content">
<p>To make things simpler, we typically just use a single data type for whole numbers, and a single data type for decimal numbers. By using the same type consistently throughout our programs, we can avoid many issues related to data types and casting.</p>
<p>As stated above, most of the examples in this book will use the <code>int</code> data type for whole numbers, and the <code>double</code> data type for decimal numbers. These choices are consistent with the majority of official Java code.</p>

<h1>Other Types</h1>
<p>Beyond numbers, there are a few other primitive data types in Java. Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at them and see how they can be used in our programs.</p>
<h2 id="boolean">Boolean</h2>
<p>Java supports a primitive data type named <code>boolean</code> that can only store two values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. As we might expect, we can use these boolean variables to store answers to questions in our program, such as &ldquo;Is <code>x</code> greater than <code>y</code>?&rdquo; At this point, we won&rsquo;t use boolean variables for much in our programs, but in a later module we&rsquo;ll cover the basics of boolean logic and learn how to use these variables to control how our program runs.</p>
<h2 id="character">Character</h2>
<p>Java also has a <code>char</code> data type, which can be used to store a single character of text. It uses the 16-bit Unicode format to store the data, which is the same as ASCII for simple characters and commands.</p>
<h2 id="declaring--assigning">Declaring &amp; Assigning</h2>
<p>To declare a variable using these data types, the format is the same as the numerical data types:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">boolean</span> t<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">char</span> c<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can also assign values to each variable. For example, to assign a value to a boolean variable, we could do this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">boolean</span> t<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>t <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">true</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">boolean</span> f <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">false</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that both <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are <em>keywords</em> in Java, which means that we won&rsquo;t have to put them in quotation marks to use them. These values can be used to directly represent the boolean values True and False, respectively. Some programming languages, most notably C, do not support boolean values in this way, but Java includes them as keywords.</p>
<p>For characters, the process is similar:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">char</span> c<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>c <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;a&#39;</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">char</span> d <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;B&#39;</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that we use a single quotation mark <code>'</code> around character values in our code. This is very important to remember! In our Hello World example, we used double quotation marks <code>&quot;</code> around <em>strings</em>, or sentences of text. For a single character, however, we only use a single quotation mark.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the Java compiler will catch this problem pretty quickly. For example, take a look at this code, and see if you can spot the errors:</p>

<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/image_4.png" alt="Compilation Error"></p>
<p>As we can see, the compiler will not allow us to assign the string <code>&quot;a&quot;</code> to the variable <code>c</code>, which is of type <code>char</code>. So, to fix this error, we&rsquo;ll need to modify our code to be the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">char</span> c <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;a&#39;</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, there might be another error in this code. Can you spot it? What will be printed to the screen when we run this program?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find out:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/image_5.png" alt="Program Output"></p>
<p>You might have expected the program to output <code>a</code>, but instead it output <code>c</code>. This is because we have <code>&quot;c&quot;</code> inside of our <code>System.out.println</code> method. To print the value stored inside a variable, we shouldn&rsquo;t put it in quotation marks. Otherwise, it will interpret that as a string, and print the name of the variable (or whatever is in quotation marks) instead.</p>

<h1>Operators</h1>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve learned how to create our own variables, we can use them to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations. For most of these, we&rsquo;ll use the same operator symbols that we&rsquo;ve used before in math, but a few of them are unique to programming languages like Java.</p>
<p>For each of the examples below, we&rsquo;ll assume that we have already created two <code>int</code> variables, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 5<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 8<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="addition-">Addition <code>+</code></h2>
<p>Using the plus <code>+</code> symbol, we can add two numbers together and find their sum:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> y<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>z<span style="color:#f92672">);</span> <span style="color:#75715e">// 13
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Since 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 + 8 = 13 $</span>, this program would output <code>13</code>.</p>
<p>When writing our code, it is always good practice to put spaces between operators and operands unless otherwise noted, just to make it easier to read our code.</p>
<p>The plus symbol can also be use to <em>concatenate</em> or link multiple strings together. We&rsquo;ll learn how to do that in the project for this chapter.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle note">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Code Comments</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>We can add <em>comments</em> to our code to help us describe it to others or simply understand it better ourselves. These comments are simply text that is added to the source code, but they are marked in a way that tells the compiler to ignore it when compiling the program.</p>
<p>In Java, we can use two forward slashes <code>//</code> to tell the compiler that everything on that line following those symbols should be treated as a comment, as we can see in the examples on this page.</p>
<p>We can also use a forward slash followed by an asterisk <code>/*</code> to start a <em>multiline comment</em> in Java. The compiler will ignore everything after that symbol until a closing asterisk followed by a forward slash <code>*/</code> is found.</p>
<p>Finally, Java also uses a forward slash followed by two asterisk <code>/**</code> to denote special comments that can be used to automatically generate documentation for the code. Again, this comment section is closed by an asterisk followed by a forward slash <code>*/</code>.</p>
<p>Traditionally, each additional line in these multiline comments will be prefixed by an asterisk to make them easier to read. In fact, the Codio editor will do that for us!</p>
<p>Here are some examples in code showing how those comments can be used.</p>

<h2 id="subtraction--">Subtraction <code>-</code></h2>
<p>Likewise, we can use the minus <code>-</code> symbol to subtract two values and find their difference:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> y<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This program would output <code>-3</code>, since 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 - 8 = -3 $</span>. It is important to remember that these operations can result in negative numbers, so the order of operands we use matters when subtracting.</p>
<p>We can also use the minus symbol to find the additive inverse of a number, or change the sign of a variable from positive to negative and vice-versa:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span>x <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> y<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(-</span>z<span style="color:#f92672">);</span> <span style="color:#75715e">// 13
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we use <code>-x</code> to denote the inverse of <code>x</code>. In this case, we don&rsquo;t include a space between the minus symbol and the variable it is attached to. So, this expression will calculate 
<span class="math align-center">$ -5 - 8 = -13 $</span> and store that value in <code>z</code>. Then, when we print that variable, we invert it again, so it will actually print <code>13</code> to the screen instead of the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ -13 $</span> stored in <code>z</code>.</p>
<h2 id="multiplication-">Multiplication <code>*</code></h2>
<p>We can also use the asterisk <code>*</code> or star symbol for multiplication to find the product of two numbers:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> y<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>z<span style="color:#f92672">);</span> <span style="color:#75715e">// 40
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>We know that 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 * 8 = 40 $</span>, so this program would output <code>40</code> as expected.</p>
<h2 id="division-">Division <code>/</code></h2>
<p>Division is a bit different. Most programming languages use the forward slash <code>/</code> symbol for division, making the statement look like a fraction. That is probably the easiest way to think about division in a programming language - it makes a fraction of the dividend and the divisor.</p>
<p>Earlier in this chapter we discussed that strange things may happen when we try to divide two whole numbers. Let&rsquo;s look at a few examples:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> y<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>z<span style="color:#f92672">);</span> <span style="color:#75715e">// 0
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This first example will calculate 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 / 8 $</span> but store it in an <code>int</code> variable. We expect the answer to be 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0.625 $</span>, but since an <code>int</code> variable can only store a whole number, the result is <em>truncated</em> by removing the decimal portion. So, our program just outputs <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span>x <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> y<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>z<span style="color:#f92672">);</span> <span style="color:#75715e">// 0
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>We know that 
<span class="math align-center">$ -5 / 8 = -0.625 $</span>, but once again the result is <em>truncated</em> and the decimal part is removed. So, this program will also output <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at another division example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">double</span> z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> y<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>z<span style="color:#f92672">);</span> <span style="color:#75715e">// 0.0
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here we are storing the result in a <code>double</code> variable. We&rsquo;d expect the output to be <code>0.625</code>, but we actually just get <code>0.0</code> when we run this program. That&rsquo;s strange, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Earlier we discussed some of the rules for how a programming language calculates numbers. One of those rules states that an operation performed on two whole numbers will result in a whole number, which is exactly what is happening here. The processor calculates 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 / 8 = 0 $</span> as a whole number using truncated division, then converts the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span> to a floating point value before storing it in <code>z</code>. So, even though it appears we should be storing 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0.625 $</span>, we aren&rsquo;t able to due to the data types of our two operands. This is a very common mistake made by programmers of all skill levels, so it is very important to understand what is going on.</p>
<p>So, how can we solve this issue? The answer lies in the use of a <em>cast</em> operation to convert the data type of one of our operators to a floating point value. Here&rsquo;s an example showing how to accomplish that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">double</span> z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">double</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> y<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>z<span style="color:#f92672">);</span> <span style="color:#75715e">// 0.625
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we are casting the value stored in <code>x</code> to be of type <code>double</code>. Then, the division operation is performed, this time between a floating point number and a whole number, which will result in a floating point number. Finally, that result will be stored in <code>z</code>, and the program will output <code>0.625</code>, which is the correct answer.</p>
<p>In short, we need to make sure we pay special attention when dividing numbers in our programs, just to make sure we are getting the result we expect.</p>
<h2 id="modulo-">Modulo <code>%</code></h2>
<p>The modulo operator uses the percent sign <code>%</code> to calculate the remainder of a division operation. Let&rsquo;s look at an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">%</span> y<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>z<span style="color:#f92672">);</span> <span style="color:#75715e">// 5
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here, we are calculating the remainder of the division 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 / 8 $</span>. Since 
<span class="math align-center">$ 8 $</span> does not go into 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> at all, we are left with 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> as the remainder of that division.</p>
<p>If we reverse the operands, we can get a different result:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">%</span> x<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>z<span style="color:#f92672">);</span> <span style="color:#75715e">// 3
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here, we are calculating the remainder of 
<span class="math align-center">$ 8 / 5 $</span>. Since 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> will go into 
<span class="math align-center">$ 8 $</span> once, we can perform 
<span class="math align-center">$ 8 - 5 = 3 $</span> to find the remainder of that division.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Modulo &amp; Negative Numbers</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>In Java, the modulo operation is treated like a true remainder operation. So, when applied to negative numbers, it will perform the expected division and return the remainder, which may be a negative number, depending on the signs of the operands. It follows the same sign rule as multiplication and division.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>

    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="increment---decrement---">Increment <code>++</code> &amp; Decrement <code>--</code></h2>
<p>Increment <code>++</code> and decrement <code>--</code> are two special operators in Java. They are used to add or subtract 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> from an existing variable. Let&rsquo;s look at a couple of examples:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x<span style="color:#f92672">++;</span>

</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>z<span style="color:#f92672">);</span> <span style="color:#75715e">// 5
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here, the increment operator will increase the value stored in <code>x</code> by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>. In this case, we don&rsquo;t include a space between the operator and the variable it is attached to. However, since the operator is <em>after</em> the variable, it will happen at the end of the operation. So, the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> will be stored in <code>z</code> first, then <code>x</code> will be incremented by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> afterwards. So, the program will output <code>6</code> as the value of <code>x</code>, and <code>5</code> as the value of <code>z</code>.</p>
<p>By placing the increment operator in front of the variable, we can see a different outcome:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">++</span>x<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we&rsquo;d expect, here the increment operation will be performed first, and then the new value stored in <code>x</code> will also be stored in <code>z</code>, so both variables will contain the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span> in this program.</p>
<p>The decrement operator works similarly, subtracting 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> instead of adding 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>.</p>
<p>In practice, these operators are only used in a few scenarios, most notably within loops to increment or decrement a counter variable. In general, they can make our code more complex and difficult to read due to the variety of different ways these operators can be used.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-shortcuts">Assignment Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Finally, many operators in Java also have combined operation and assignment operators. These will perform the operation specified and store the value in the first variable, all in a single statement.</p>

<p>As with the increment and decrement operators, some of these shortcuts are rarely used in practice since they can make our code more difficult to read and understand. However, in some scenarios they can be quite helpful.</p>
<h2 id="order-of-operations">Order of Operations</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9v4yJrow9A">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>

<a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/02-data-types-math/08-java/04-operators/video/">Video Materials</a></p>
<p>We are already familiar with the order of operations in mathematics, using mnemonics such as &ldquo;PEMDAS&rdquo; to refer to the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parentheses</li>
<li>Exponents</li>
<li>Multiplication &amp; Division</li>
<li>Addition &amp; Subtraction</li>
</ol>
<p>Programing languages work very similarly, but there are many more operators to deal with. Here&rsquo;s a quick list of the order of operations, or <em>operator precedence</em> of the operators we&rsquo;ve covered so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parentheses</li>
<li><em>Postfix:</em> Increment <code>++</code> &amp; Decrement <code>--</code> after variable*</li>
<li><em>Prefix:</em> Inverse <code>-</code>, Increment <code>++</code> &amp; Decrement <code>--</code> before variable*</li>
<li><em>Multiplicative</em>: Multiplication <code>*</code>, Division <code>/</code>, and Modulo <code>%</code></li>
<li><em>Additive</em>: Addition <code>+</code>, Subtraction <code>-</code></li>
<li><em>Assignment</em>: <code>=</code>, <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code>, <code>%=</code></li>
</ol>
<p><em>* The increment and decrement operations will be calculated either before or after the rest of the operation is performed, depending on where they are placed in relation to the associated variable. This lists what order they will be analyzed by the compiler to determine which variable they are attached to.</em></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick example to show how this works:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 1<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">++</span>x <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">%</span> x<span style="color:#f92672">--;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>x<span style="color:#f92672">);</span> 
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>y<span style="color:#f92672">);</span> 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Can we determine what the output should be? Let&rsquo;s try to break it down!</p>
<p>Based on the operator precedence table above, we know that the <code>x--</code> will be evaluated first. However, since it is after the variable, it won&rsquo;t be calculated until after the rest of the operation is complete. So, we can just remember that step for now, and we&rsquo;ll actually perform that calculation last.</p>
<p>Next, we know that <code>++x</code> will be evaluated. This step must be performed before any other operation since it is before the variable, so we must immediately increment the value of <code>x</code> by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>. So, <code>x</code> is now 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span>.</p>
<p>Now we can perform all of the multiplicative operations, going from left to right. So, by adding the appropriate parentheses, we&rsquo;d calculate the following:</p>
<p>
<span class="math align-center">$$ x + x - x / x * x \% x $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ 2 + 2 - 2 / 2 * 2 \% 2 $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ 2 + 2 - (2 / 2) * 2 \% 2 $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ 2 + 2 - ((2 / 2 * 2) \% 2 $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ 2 + 2 - (((2 / 2) * 2) \% 2) $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ 2 + 2 - ((1 * 2) \% 2) $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ 2 + 2 - (2 \% 2) $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ 2 + 2 - 0 $$</span></p>
<p>Following that, we can perform any additive operations. Once again, we can add parentheses as appropriate to find the following:</p>
<p>
<span class="math align-center">$$ 2 + 2 - 0 $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ (2 + 2) - 0 $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ ((2 + 2) - 0) $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ (4 - 0) $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ 4 $$</span></p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve calculated all of the operations on the right-hand side of the assignment operator, we can then perform the assignment operation to store the final value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span> in <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, we must remember to go back and decrement the value in <code>x</code> by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>, so <code>x</code> once again is just 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>.</p>
<p>So, the final output from this program would be:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/image_6.png" alt="Operators Example"></p>
<p>However, as any good math teacher will tell us, it is always better to use additional parentheses to make sure our operations are performed in the correct order instead of relying on the order of operations. So, we should definitely avoid writing code as ambiguous as the example given above.</p>

<h1>Command-Line Arguments</h1>
<!-- TODO Simplify? -->
<p>The Linux command line consists of the command and the arguments.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/javacmdlne.png" alt="linux command line for java"></p>
<p>In our case the command, the word Linux translates into action is &ldquo;java&rdquo;. Everything else is packaged up as string-values and sent to the Java Virtual Machine. The JVM takes the file name, starts the program with that file name, and passes the remaining items (arguments) to the program.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-command-line-arguments-in-a-object-oriented-program">Accessing Command-line Arguments in a Object Oriented Program</h3>
<p>By OOP convention, the command line arguments are sent to the programs&rsquo;s <code>main</code> method.  Java handles this automatically.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/J_cl2.png" alt="linux command line for java"></p>
<p>Inside Java, the command line arguments are mapped (assigned) to a the parameter variable in the <code>main</code> method called <code>args</code>. In main <code>args</code> is an <b>array</b> of <b>Strings</b>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/J_cl3.png" alt="Java map of cmd line arguments"></p>
<h4 id="accessing-arguments">Accessing arguments</h4>
<p>Arrays are ordered collections of data, you might think of it as a numbered list.  You access elements of the array using the indexing operator <code>[]</code>, the indexes start at 0<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The syntax is <code>variableName[indexNumber]</code>.</p>
<p><code>args</code> is always an array of strings, in the order they appeared on the command line.</p>
<h4 id="converting-arguments">Converting arguments</h4>
<p>Since <code>args</code> is always an array of Strings.  Programmers convert args-elements (values in the args-array) to the appropriate type.   This is typically done using <code>.parse..</code> methods.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Syntax</th>
<th>Semantics</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>int x = Integer.parseInt(args[0])</code></td>
<td>Take the string in args at index 0</br>Convert it to an int</br>Assign it to x</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>double x =Double.parseDouble(args[0])</code></td>
<td>Take the string in args at index 0</br>Convert it to a double</br>Assign it to x</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If you try and convert something that doe not make sense, <code>Double.parseDouble(&quot;act&quot;)</code> or <code>Integer.parseInt(&quot;3.1415&quot;)</code>, you&rsquo;ll get an error.</p>
<h3 id="someprogramjava">SomeProgram.java</h3>
<p>A proper command line for running <code>SomeProgram.java</code> would be <code>java SomeProgram &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;</code>  or <code>java SomeProgram 2 3</code>.  At this juncture let&rsquo;s trace the execution <code>SomeProgram.java</code> as if the command line where <code>java SomeProgram 2 3</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code> 1: public class SomeProgram{

</ol>
<p>The trace of this program is <code>{ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }</code>.  As you may recall from CC 110 , being able to trace the execution of code by hand is key to ensuring complete test case coverage and successful de-bugging.  More on tracing in module 4.</p>

<h1>Subgoals - Evaluating Expressions</h1>
<p>One of the unique parts of this course will be the inclusion of subgoals to help us better understand what is going on in our code. Subgoals are designed to help us structure our thinking process in a way that matches what an experienced developer might have.</p>
<p>A great example is learning how to read. Fluent readers can read whole words at a time, while processing and retaining information from several sentences at once. Novice readers have to sound out words one letter at a time, and can store and retain a few words at a time in memory before being overwhelmed by information. Learning a new language can quickly make this difference very apparent, even for readers who are fluent in many languages.</p>
<p>Writing computer code is very similar. An experienced developer can fluently read and write code, seeing and understanding entire code structures at a glance. Novice developers often have to look at a single line at a time, and break it down into individual parts before it is apparent what the code says. That&rsquo;s just part of the learning process!</p>
<p>To make this process easier, this course will include many pages that describe subgoals we can use to help analyze and write code. In essence, we can treat these subgoals as a set of steps to follow mentally when performing these tasks. Over time, we&rsquo;ll become more comfortable with each task, and the subgoals will quickly become ingrained knowledge. Just like we can easily read both &ldquo;cat&rdquo; and &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo; at a glance, with practice we&rsquo;ll be able to read code just as quickly!</p>

<h2 id="analyzing-expressions">Analyzing Expressions</h2>
<p>To analyze an expression involving variables and mathematical operators in code, here are some mental subgoals we can use:</p>
<h3 id="1-check-types">1. Check Types</h3>
<p>First, we must determine whether the data type of the expression is compatible with the data type of the variable we want to store it in. In Java, we must be very careful to make sure we are only storing whole numbers in the integer data type, and floating point values in the double data type.</p>
<h3 id="2-perform-prefix-operations">2. Perform Prefix Operations</h3>
<p>Next, we should look at the expression to determine if there are any prefixed operations that must occur first. In Java, for example, we could find a prefixed increment operator like <code>++x</code>, so we&rsquo;ll need to update the value of <code>x</code> before moving to the next step.</p>
<h3 id="3-solve-arithmetic-equation">3. Solve Arithmetic Equation</h3>
<p>At this point, we can solve the arithmetic equation using the order of operations for our language. This simply involves the process of substituting values for variables and performing the requested operations. However, once again we must be careful to make sure that the operands provided to each operator are valid and produce the correct data type. The example we saw earlier for handling a large equation showed us a great way to work through this process.</p>
<h3 id="4-confirm-data-type-of-result--store-it">4. Confirm Data Type of Result &amp; Store It</h3>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve solved the arithmetic equation, we should be left with a variable on the left side of the equals sign and a single value on the right side. So, once again, we should confirm that the value on the right can be stored in the data type of the variable on the left.</p>
<h3 id="5-perform-postfix-operations">5. Perform Postfix Operations</h3>
<p>Finally, if the original expression included any postfix operations, such as a postfixed decrement like <code>x--</code> in Java, we&rsquo;ll need to update the value of <code>x</code> before moving on to the next line.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through an example showing how to use these subgoals to evaluate a few expression statements.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 3 <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> 5<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We&rsquo;ll break this down by subgoals:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can easily confirm that the data type of the variable is <code>int</code>, and that the numbers on the right side of the equation are all integers, so we shouldn&rsquo;t have any issues with data types initially.</li>
<li>This reminds us to look for prefix operations. Since there aren&rsquo;t any, we can move on.</li>
<li>We can now solve the arithmetic equation on the right side of the expression. So, we can easily find that <code>3 + 5</code> can be replaced with <code>8</code>.</li>
<li>This tells us to once again confirm that the result is a compatible value for the data type of the variable on the left. Since <code>8</code> can be stored in an <code>int</code> variable, we are just fine. So, we can update the value of <code>x</code> to <code>8</code>.</li>
<li>Finally, we must look for any postfix operations in the original equation. Since there aren&rsquo;t any, we can skip this step.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it! While this may seem like quite a bit of information for handling a simple statement, it becomes much more useful as the statements get more complex.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a second example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 5<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">double</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 3<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">5</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">double</span> z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">++</span>x <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span>y<span style="color:#f92672">--;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once again, let&rsquo;s break the last line in this code example down by subgoals to evaluate the expression:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is a bit tricky, since the statement includes several variables. However, we can look at the earlier code to see that <code>x</code> is an integer type, and <code>y</code> is a double type. Since this expression is adding them together, the result should be a floating point number, which can be stored back in the variable <code>z</code> with type double. So, we should be fine here.</li>
<li>Next, we&rsquo;ll see that there is a prefix expression <code>++x</code>, so we&rsquo;ll increment the value of <code>x</code> by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span>. We also see a prefix operator <code>-y</code>, so we&rsquo;ll need to remember that we are dealing with the inverse of the value stored in <code>y</code>.</li>
<li>Now we can solve the equations. To do this, we&rsquo;ll replace each variable with its value, then calculate the result. So, <code>x + -y</code> becomes <code>6 + -3.5</code> which results in <code>2.5</code>.</li>
<li>Once we have the result, we must confirm that it can be stored in the variable to the left. Since <code>2.5</code> is a floating point number, it can be stored in the double data type. So, we&rsquo;ll update the value of <code>z</code> to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2.5 $</span>.</li>
<li>Finally, we&rsquo;ll need to look for any postfix operators in the original equation. We&rsquo;ll see <code>y--</code>, so we must decrement the value of <code>y</code> by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2.5 $</span></li>
</ol>
<p>So, at the end of this short code example, we&rsquo;ll see that <code>x</code> is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span>, <code>y</code> is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2.5 $</span>, and <code>z</code> is also 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2.5 $</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s look at one more example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 5<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">double</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 8<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">5</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> y<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here&rsquo;s how we can break down the process of evaluating the last line in this example:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, just like the example above, we see that <code>x</code> is an integer and <code>y</code> is a double, so the sum of those values should also be a double. However, we&rsquo;ll see that <code>z</code> is an integer. So, what will happen here? As it turns out, the Java compiler will give us an error when we try to compile this code, because we are assigning a double value to an integer which could result in the loss of data.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we can see, by carefully following these subgoals, we can even find errors in our code, just by evaluating it step by step.</p>

<h1>Subgoals - Writing Expressions</h1>
<p>We can also use subgoals to help us write new expressions in our code. These subgoals help us understand each part of the process of building a new expression, and they also help us avoid many common errors.</p>
<h2 id="writing-expressions">Writing Expressions</h2>
<p>Here are the subgoals for writing a new expression:</p>
<h3 id="1-find-variable-in-problem-statement">1. Find Variable in Problem Statement</h3>
<p>The first step is to determine which part of the problem statement will be represented by a variable. Sometimes this is obvious, and other times it is not. This may be a new variable that we are creating, or it could be an update to an existing variable.</p>
<h3 id="2-determine-name-and-data-type-of-variable">2. Determine Name and Data Type of Variable</h3>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve found a variable to work with, we must also determine the variable&rsquo;s name and data type. Once again, this may be obviously found in the problem statement, but other times we must think a bit more about what type of data will be stored in the variable. If we are working with an existing variable, we&rsquo;ll need to make sure that the data type of that variable is compatible with the type of data we&rsquo;d like to store in it. Of course, we should also make sure the variable has a descriptive and memorable name if we are creating a new one.</p>
<h3 id="3-build-arithmetic-equation-with-operators">3. Build Arithmetic Equation with Operators</h3>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve isolated our variable, we must build an arithmetic equation and operators required to produce the desired value. This may involve using additional variables in our equations as well.</p>
<h3 id="4-build-expression">4. Build Expression</h3>
<p>Once we have our arithmetic equation, we can then build the overall expression. This usually consists of three parts: the variable on the left, an assignment operator in the middle, and the arithmetic equation on the right.</p>
<h3 id="5-make-sure-operators-and-operands-are-compatible">5. Make sure Operators and Operands are Compatible</h3>
<p>Finally, once we&rsquo;ve constructed the overall expression, we should check and make sure that all operators and operands are compatible. This means making sure that we aren&rsquo;t trying to assign a floating point value to an integer, or dividing two integers and expecting a floating point number as a result.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick example to show how this process works. Consider the following problem statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given two whole numbers, find the remainder of dividing the first number by the second number.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use the subgoals listed above to build an expression for this problem statement</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we must identify our variables. Looking at this problem statement, we see that it expects us to be given two whole numbers. So, we&rsquo;ll probably need two integer variables to represent those two numbers. Then, we&rsquo;ll need a third variable to store the remainder. In total, we can easily identify three variables that we&rsquo;ll need to create for this program.</li>
<li>Next, we must determine the name and type of each of these variables. To make it very clear, I&rsquo;m going to label the two input variables <code>inputA</code> and <code>inputB</code>, and the remainder variable <code>remainder</code>. We can also determine that each of them should be the <code>int</code> type, since we are only dealing with whole numbers. So, our code might begin with these three variable declarations:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> inputA<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> inputB<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> remainder<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><ol start="3">
<li>Now we can assemble our arithmetic equation. We need to calculate the remainder of dividing <code>inputA</code> by <code>inputB</code>, so we can use the modulo operation <code>%</code> to find this value. So, our arithmetic equation could be <code>inputA % inputB</code>.</li>
<li>Then, we can build the overall expression itself. Since we want to store the result of the arithmetic equation in <code>remainder</code>, we&rsquo;ll build the line <code>remainder = inputA % inputB</code> as our entire expression. So, we can add that to our code:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> inputA<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> inputB<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> remainder<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>remainder <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> inputA <span style="color:#f92672">%</span> inputB<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><ol start="5">
<li>Finally, we must make sure our operators and operands are all compatible. Since we know that both <code>inputA</code> and <code>inputB</code> are integers, the result of the modulo operation would also be an integer. So, this line is valid.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, the part we are missing is the values for <code>inputA</code> and <code>inputB</code>. At this point, we haven&rsquo;t covered how to accept user input yet, so we can assume that those values are hard-coded into the program. So, our final program might look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> inputA<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> inputB<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> remainder<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>inputA <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 5<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>inputB <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 8<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>remainder <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> inputA <span style="color:#f92672">%</span> inputB<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Using these subgoals is a very great way to learn how to build programs one step at a time. As we learn more about programming and get more experience, many of these steps will become automatic. This is very similar to how we write sentences by hand. We typically don&rsquo;t think about each letter as we write it once we are fluent with the language, but instead we think of entire words and our brain is able to send the correct commands to produce the desired output. With time and practice, writing code will be very similar.</p>

<h1>Printing Text &amp; Numbers</h1>
<h2 id="printing-text-with-variables">Printing Text with Variables</h2>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve learned how to run our program and provide it some input, we must also learn how to provide output that includes our variables as well as text all on the same line. There are a few ways to accomplish this.</p>
<p>First, we can use <code>System.out.print()</code> to print text without a newline character at the end, so that the next output will begin on the same line. So, we could use that to print text and variables on the same line. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 1<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 2<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">print</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Variable x: &#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">print</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>x<span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">print</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;, Variable y: &#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>y<span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>will produce this output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Variable x: 1, Variable y: 2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In Java, we can also concatenate multiple outputs together using the <code>+</code> symbol. So, we could produce similar output using this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 1<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 2<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Variable x: &#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34; , Variable y: &#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> y<span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>which should output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Variable x: 1 , Variable y: 2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that we needed to include an extra space after <code>1</code> in the output. This is because Java does not add a space between strings when concatenating them, so we must be careful to add the spaces ourselves where needed.</p>
<p>There are many ways that we can use Java to output text and variables as desired. We&rsquo;ll use some of these methods to complete this project.</p>

<h1>Types</h1>
<p>The Python programming language is a <em>dynamically typed</em> language. This means that a variable in our programs can store any type of data at any time, and we can even use the same variable to store different data types at different times in the same program. When we attempt to access the data stored in our variable, the Python interpreter determines if the data type of the variable can be used for that operation.</p>
<p>The major advantage of this approach is that it is very quick and easy to build programs in this language without worrying about the types of data that may be used. We could be storing integers, floating point numbers, or any other data type, and we won&rsquo;t have to change the variables we are using in our program.</p>
<p>The biggest downside to this approach is that it can be a bit more difficult to debug errors in our programs related to data types. While any variable can store any type, we must still make sure that we are using the correct types of data in each operation. In Python, the interpreter will only give us an error when we try to use a variable with an invalid data type stored inside it.</p>
<p>To make dealing with types a bit easier, when dealing with mixed integer-float math, Python will automatically convert the integer into a float type without any additional code. For example, an integer in Python can be treated as a floating point number, since a floating point number has a larger size than an integer.</p>
<p>However, the opposite case is not true. In Python, we cannot treat a floating point number as an integer without explicitly converting the data type. We&rsquo;ll see how to do that later in this chapter.</p>

<h1>Numbers</h1>
<p>Most of the computer programs we&rsquo;ll write must deal with numbers in some way. So, it makes perfect sense to start working with the numerical data types, since we&rsquo;ll use them very often. Let&rsquo;s dive in and see how we can use these numerical data types in Python!</p>
<p>Python has several built-in classes for representing numbers, text and logical values.  All Python variables thus refer to full fledged objects.</p>
<h2 id="integers">Integers</h2>
<p>The first data type we&rsquo;ll learn about in Python is the one for storing whole numbers, called <code>int</code> class. In Python, any whole number without a decimal point is considered to be an <code>int</code> by default, and the only limit on the size of the number is the amount of memory available on our system. So, Python is great at storing even very large numbers!</p>
<h2 id="floating-points">Floating Points</h2>
<p>To store a floating point number in Python, we&rsquo;ll use the <code>float</code> type. Python uses a 64-bit &ldquo;double-precision&rdquo; format to store this number, which is very similar to the <code>double</code> data type in many other languages such as Java. Any literal followed by a decimal, or in scientific notation is interpreted as a <code>float</code>.  The table below shows different inferred types for various ways to write one hundred.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>literal</th>
<th>inferred Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>int</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100.</td>
<td>float</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1E2</td>
<td>float</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It is difficult to discuss the minimum and maximum value for this data types, as it requires a thorough understanding of how it is stored in binary and interpreted by the processor in a computer. In general, a <code>float</code> in Python can handle values in the range of 
<span class="math align-center">$  \pm 10^{\pm 308}  $</span>.</p>
<p>However, just like scientific notation, the numbers it stores can at best be only as accurate as the number of digits it holds. So, when storing an extremely large number, there will be some rounding error.</p>
<h2 id="using-numbers-in-code">Using Numbers in Code</h2>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve discussed the various data types available in Python, let&rsquo;s look at how we can actually create variables that can store data in our programs.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-variable">Creating a Variable</h3>
<p>To create a variable in Python, we must simply give it a name and assign it a value, using a syntax similar to this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;identifier&gt; = &lt;expression&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In that example, <code>&lt;identifier&gt;</code> is any valid identifier that can be used as a variable name in Python, and <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> is any valid Python expression that produces a value. It could be a number, another variable, a mathematical operation, or even a method call, which we&rsquo;ll learn about in a later chapter. The variable we are storing the value in must always be on the left side of the equals <code>=</code> sign.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Identifier Rules &amp; Conventions</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Python has rules about the allowable names with can be used as identifiers.  Basically an identifier can start with any upper or lower case letter, or the underscore <code>_</code>.  You may use any combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, underscores and numbers after the first position.  The actual rule is located 

<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, but may be a bit too technical at this point.</p>
<p>By convention, variable names should be descriptive and use snake_case to aid in reading.  Variables starting with the underscore character convey special meanings.  Avoid starting with <code>_</code> for now.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>For example, if we want to store the integer value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> in a variable named <code>x</code>, we could write the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The same syntax applies to floating point numbers:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1.2</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When assigning values from one variable to another using primitive data types, the value is <em>copied</em> in memory. So, changing the value of the first variable would not affect the others, as in this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>At the end of that code, the value of <code>x</code> is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span>, but <code>y</code> still contains 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span>. This is important to remember.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle tip">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Try It!</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>See if you can create a variable using each of the data types listed above in <code>Types.py</code>! Can you find any values that cause errors?</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h3 id="printing">Printing</h3>
<p>We can also use the <code>print</code> method we learned earlier to output the current value of a variable to the screen. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(x)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that the variable <code>x</code> is not in quotation marks. This way, we&rsquo;ll be able to print the <em>value</em> stored in the variable <code>x</code> to the screen. If we place it in quotation marks, we&rsquo;ll just print the letter <code>x</code> instead.</p>
<p>Later, in the project for this chapter, we&rsquo;ll learn how to combine multiple variables into a single output.</p>
<h3 id="determining-type">Determining Type</h3>
<p>Python includes a special method, <code>type()</code>, that can be used to determine the type of a variable. Here&rsquo;s an example of how it could be used:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1.2</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(x))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(y))
</span></span></code></pre></div>
  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle tip">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Follow Along</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Try to run these examples by placing each one in <code>Types.py</code> and seeing what happens. Does it work? Try it before reading the answers below.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>When we run that program, we should see the following output:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/2.6.p.2.type.png" alt="Python Type Method"></p>
<p>In the output, we can see that variable <code>x</code> is of type <code>int</code>, and variable <code>y</code> is of type <code>float</code>. This is exactly as we&rsquo;d expect, since <code>x</code> is a whole number and <code>y</code> is a rational, or floating point, number.</p>
<h3 id="casting">Casting</h3>
<p>When writing our programs, sometimes we need to change the data type that a particular value is stored as, especially when we want to store it in a new variable. Ideally, we would construct our programs to avoid this issue, but in the real world we aren&rsquo;t always so lucky.</p>
<p>To change the data type of a value, we can <em>cast</em> that value to a different data type. To cast a value to a different data type, we can use special methods that are named after each data type.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the example below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1.7</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(x)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(y)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(y))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we&rsquo;ve created a <code>float</code> variable <code>x</code>, and stored 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1.7 $</span> in that variable. We then create a new variable <code>y</code>, and convert the value in <code>x</code> to an <code>int</code> before storing it in <code>y</code>, using the <code>int()</code> method. When we run this program, we&rsquo;ll see the following output:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/2.6.p.2.cast.png" alt="Python Cast Method"></p>
<p>As expected, <code>y</code> is a variable of type <code>int</code>. However, we notice that the value stored in <code>y</code> is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>. This is because the <code>int()</code> conversion method will <em>truncate</em>, or remove, the decimal portion of the number.</p>
<p>In general, we should write our programs carefully so that we avoid ever needing to convert the type of a variable. However, in practice, it is sometimes necessary to do so.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Cast vs. Convert</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Technically <code>float()</code>, <code>int()</code> and later <code>str()</code> <strong>convert</strong> their argument (the value in the parentheses) into the appropriate type.  Where necessary the binary representation of the is changed.  Conversion preserves the semantics (meaning) but over writes the binary.</p>
<p><strong>Casting</strong> using the <code>.cast()</code> method preserves the original binary but may result in gibberish; you lose the meaning.</p>
<p>However, &ldquo;casting&rdquo; is nearly always used to mean &ldquo;convert&rdquo;.  It comes from the origins of programming, where languages supported fewer types and the binary had the same semantic meaning across multiple data types.</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>type</th><th>bytes</th><th>binary for the value of 2</th></tr>
    <tr><td>byte</td><td>1</td><td>00000010<td></tr>
    <tr><td>short</td><td>2</td><td>0000000000000010<td></tr>
    <tr><td>int</td><td>4</td><td>00000000000000000000000000000010<td></tr>
</table>
<p>From the above table we can see how casting might work for various sized integer values. Leading &ldquo;bits&rdquo; were ignored when casting to a byte-wise smaller type.  Leading 0s were adding when casting to larger type.</p>
<p>We will use cast and convert interchangeably in this course to mean convert to the desired data type.</p>

<h1>Other Types</h1>
<p>There are a few other built in data classes in Python. Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at them and see how they can be used in our programs.</p>
<h2 id="complex-numbers">Complex Numbers</h2>
<p>A complex number is used to store both a <em>real</em> and an <em>imaginary</em> part of a number. These are not typically used in most programs, but they are supported in Python. To create a complex number, use the following syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;identifier&gt; = &lt;real&gt;+&lt;imaginary&gt;j
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So, to represent the complex number 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 + 2i $</span>, we would create a variable using this code:</p>

<h2 id="boolean">Boolean</h2>
<p>Python supports a primitive data type named <code>bool</code> that can only store two values: <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>. As we might expect, we can use these boolean variables to store answers to questions in our program, such as &ldquo;Is <code>x</code> greater than <code>y</code>?&rdquo; At this point, we won&rsquo;t use boolean variables for much in our programs, but in a later module we&rsquo;ll cover the basics of boolean logic and learn how to use these variables to control how our program runs.</p>
<p>To create a boolean variable, we can do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>t <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">True</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>f <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">False</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that both <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> are <em>keywords</em> in Python, which means that we won&rsquo;t have to put them in quotation marks to use them. These values can be used to directly represent the boolean values True and False, respectively. Some programming languages, most notably C, do not support boolean values in this way, but Python includes them as keywords.</p>

<h1>Operators</h1>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve learned how to create our own variables, we can use them to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations. For most of these, we&rsquo;ll use the same operator symbols that we&rsquo;ve used before in math, but a few of them are unique to programming languages like Python.</p>
<p>For each of the examples below, we&rsquo;ll assume that we have already created two <code>int</code> variables, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">8</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="addition-">Addition <code>+</code></h2>
<p>Using the plus <code>+</code> symbol, we can add two numbers together and find their sum:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(z) <span style="color:#75715e"># 13</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Since 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 + 8 = 13 $</span>, this program would output <code>13</code>.</p>
<p>When writing our code, it is always good practice to put spaces between operators and operands unless otherwise noted, just to make it easier to read our code.</p>
<p>The plus symbol can also be use to <em>concatenate</em> or link multiple strings together. We&rsquo;ll learn how to do that in the project for this chapter.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle note">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Code Comments</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>We can add <em>comments</em> to our code to help us describe it to others or simply understand it better ourselves. These comments are simply text that is added to the source code, but they are marked in a way that tells the compiler to ignore it when compiling the program.</p>
<p>In Python, we can use the number sign or hash symbol <code>#</code> to tell the compiler that everything on that line following those symbols should be treated as a comment, as we can see in the examples on this page.</p>
<p>We can also use three quotation marks <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;</code> before and after a block to text to create a <em>multiline comment</em>. However, these are not precisely the same as comments, since the interpreter treats the block as a value that is not assigned to any variable.</p>
<p>That said, Python uses these mutliline comments to create <em>docstrings</em> that describe the actions of a file or method. We&rsquo;ll learn more about creating those docstrings later in this course.</p>
<p>Here are some examples in code showing how those comments can be used.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;&#34;
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">This is a docstring comment at the beginning of a file that gives
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">information about the code contained in this file
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># This is a single line comment</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span> <span style="color:#75715e"># Comments can even go after a line of code</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Feel free to use comments anywhere in your source code to help you understand what the code does! It is always better to include too many comments than too few, especially in larger programs.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="subtraction--">Subtraction <code>-</code></h2>
<p>Likewise, we can use the minus <code>-</code> symbol to subtract two values and find their difference:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(z) <span style="color:#75715e"># -3</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This program would output <code>-3</code>, since 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 - 8 = -3 $</span>. It is important to remember that these operations can result in negative numbers, so the order of operands we use matters when subtracting.</p>
<p>We can also use the minus symbol to find the additive inverse of a number, or change the sign of a variable from positive to negative and vice-versa:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span>x <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>z) <span style="color:#75715e"># 13</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we use <code>-x</code> to denote the inverse of <code>x</code>. In this case, we don&rsquo;t include a space between the minus symbol and the variable it is attached to. So, this expression will calculate 
<span class="math align-center">$ -5 - 8 = -13 $</span> and store that value in <code>z</code>. Then, when we print that variable, we invert it again, so it will actually print <code>13</code> to the screen instead of the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ -13 $</span> stored in <code>z</code>.</p>
<h2 id="multiplication-">Multiplication <code>*</code></h2>
<p>We can also use the asterisk <code>*</code> or star symbol for multiplication to find the product of two numbers:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(z) <span style="color:#75715e"># 40</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We know that 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 * 8 = 40 $</span>, so this program would output <code>40</code> as expected.</p>
<h2 id="exponent-">Exponent <code>**</code></h2>
<p>Python also includes a special operator to perform the exponentiation, or power, operation. It is a set of two asterisks <code>**</code> or stars. We can use it as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">**</span> y <span style="color:#75715e">#alternate z = pow(x,y)</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(z) <span style="color:#75715e"># 390625</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>While it may take some work, we can verify the result of 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5^{8} = 390625 $</span> is correct.</p>
<h2 id="division-">Division <code>/</code></h2>
<p>Division is a bit different. Most programming languages use the forward slash <code>/</code> symbol for division, making the statement look like a fraction. That is probably the easiest way to think about division in a programming language - it makes a fraction of the dividend and the divisor.</p>
<p>Earlier in this chapter we discussed that strange things may happen when we try to divide two whole numbers. Let&rsquo;s look at a few examples:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(z) <span style="color:#75715e"># 0.625</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This first example will calculate 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 / 8 $</span> but store it in an <code>float</code> variable. So, even though both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are of type <code>int</code>, the result will always be of type <code>float</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, we can always convert the result to an <code>int</code> using the built-in <code>int()</code> method, as shown in this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(x <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> y)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(z) <span style="color:#75715e"># 0</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will output <code>0</code>, since <code>z</code> is now of type <code>int</code>. Remember that the <code>int()</code> function will <em>truncate</em> the decimal portion of the result.</p>
<p>In short, we need to make sure we pay special attention when dividing numbers in our programs, just to make sure we are getting the result we expect.</p>
<h2 id="floor-division-">Floor Division <code>//</code></h2>
<p>Python also includes another special operator for floor division, which is two forward slashes <code>//</code>. This operator will round the result of a division down to the next smallest whole number. Let&rsquo;s look at a couple of examples:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">//</span> y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(z) <span style="color:#75715e"># 0</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This first example will output <code>0</code>, since the result of 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 / 8 = 0.625 $</span> will be floored down to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>.</p>
<p>However, this example shows what is unique about this operation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span>x <span style="color:#f92672">//</span> y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(z) <span style="color:#75715e"># -1</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can calculate the result of 
<span class="math align-center">$ -5 / 8 = -0.625 $</span>, just as we&rsquo;d expect. However, since the floor operation will round down toward negative infinity, the output here is <code>-1</code>, which is the next smallest integer. It can be a bit confusing at first, but hopefully it makes sense.</p>
<h2 id="modulo-">Modulo <code>%</code></h2>
<p>The modulo operator uses the percent sign <code>%</code> to calculate the remainder of a division operation. Let&rsquo;s look at an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>int z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">%</span> y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(z) <span style="color:#75715e"># 5</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here, we are calculating the remainder of the division 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 / 8 $</span>. Since 
<span class="math align-center">$ 8 $</span> does not go into 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> at all, we are left with 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> as the remainder of that division.</p>
<p>If we reverse the operands, we can get a different result:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>int z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">%</span> x
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(z) <span style="color:#75715e"># 3</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here, we are calculating the remainder of 
<span class="math align-center">$ 8 / 5 $</span>. Since 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> will go into 
<span class="math align-center">$ 8 $</span> once, we can perform 
<span class="math align-center">$ 8 - 5 = 3 $</span> to find the remainder of that division.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Modulo &amp; Negative Numbers</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>In Python, the modulo operation is performed as a floor division remainder. So, if the division operation is
<span class="math align-center">$ a // b = q $</span> with remainder
<span class="math align-center">$ r $</span>, the remainder must satisfy the equation
<span class="math align-center">$ b * q + r = a $</span>. Therefore, the result may be different depending on the signs of the operands.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(int(<span style="color:#f92672">-</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">8</span> <span style="color:#f92672">%</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>))  <span style="color:#75715e"># 2</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the first example, we would perform
<span class="math align-center">$ -8 // 5 = -2 $</span>, since
<span class="math align-center">$ -2 $</span> is the next smallest whole number. Then, to find the remainder, we must satisfy the equation
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 * -2 + r = -8 $</span>. So, to solve that equation, we would find that
<span class="math align-center">$ x = 2 $</span>.</p>
<p>In the second example, we&rsquo;d perform a similar division first, which is
<span class="math align-center">$ 8 // -5 = -2 $</span>. However, when we fill in the equation, we would get
<span class="math align-center">$ -5 * -2 + r = 8 $</span>, which would yield
<span class="math align-center">$ x = -2 $</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, the third example would find the result of the division
<span class="math align-center">$ -8 // -5 = 1 $</span>. Then, we can use the second equation to find
<span class="math align-center">$ -5 * 1 + r = -8 $</span>, where
<span class="math align-center">$ r = -3 $</span> in that case.</p>
<p>In short, the value itself may change depending on the signs of the operands, so you must be careful when using the modulo operation on negative numbers.</p>

<p>Some of these shortcuts are rarely used in practice since they can make our code more difficult to read and understand. However, in some scenarios they can be quite helpful.</p>
<h2 id="order-of-operations">Order of Operations</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI9XFlFOtSQ">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>

<a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/02-data-types-math/08-python/04-operators/video/">Video Materials</a></p>
<p>We are already familiar with the order of operations in mathematics, using mnemonics such as &ldquo;PEMDAS&rdquo; to refer to the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parentheses</li>
<li>Exponents</li>
<li>Multiplication &amp; Division</li>
<li>Addition &amp; Subtraction</li>
</ol>
<p>Programing languages work very similarly, but there are many more operators to deal with. Here&rsquo;s a quick list of the order of operations, or <em>operator precedence</em> of the operators we&rsquo;ve covered so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parentheses</li>
<li><em>Exponentiation:</em> <code>**</code></li>
<li><em>Prefix:</em> Inverse <code>-</code></li>
<li><em>Multiplicative</em>: Multiplication <code>*</code>, Division <code>/</code>, Floor Division <code>//</code>, and Modulo <code>%</code></li>
<li><em>Additive</em>: Addition <code>+</code>, Subtraction <code>-</code></li>
<li><em>Assignment</em>: <code>=</code>, <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code>, <code>**=</code>, <code>/=</code>, <code>//=</code>, <code>%=</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick example to show how this works:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">+=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span>x <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">**</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">%</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">//</span> x
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(x) 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Can we determine what the output should be? Let&rsquo;s try to break it down!</p>
<p>Based on the operator precedence table above, we know that the exponentiation will be evaluated first. So, let&rsquo;s perform that step:</p>
<p>
<span class="math align-center">$$ -x + x - x / x * x ^ x \% x // x $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ -2 + 2 - 2 / 2 * 2 ^ 2 \% 2 // 2 $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ -2 + 2 - 2 / 2 * (2 ^ 2) \% 2 // 2 $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ -2 + 2 - 2 / 2 * 4 \% 2 // 2 $$</span></p>
<p>Next, we can perform the inverse operation on the first number:</p>

<span class="math align-center">$$ (-2) + 2 - 2 / 2 * 4 \% 2 // 2 $$</span>
<p>Now we can perform all of the multiplicative operations, going from left to right. So, by adding the appropriate parentheses, we&rsquo;d calculate the following:</p>
<p>
<span class="math align-center">$$ (-2) + 2 - 2 / 2 * 4 \% 2 // 2 $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ (-2) + 2 - (2 / 2) * 4 \% 2 // 2 $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ (-2) + 2 - ((2 / 2) * 4) \% 2 // 2 $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ (-2) + 2 - (((2 / 2) * 4) \% 2) // 2 $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ (-2) + 2 - ((((2 / 2) * 4) \% 2) // 2) $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ (-2) + 2 - (((1.0 * 4) \% 2) // 2) $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ (-2) + 2 - ((4.0 \% 2) // 2) $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ (-2) + 2 - (0.0 // 2) $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ (-2) + 2 - 0.0 $$</span></p>
<p>Notice that the first division operation created a floating point value. From then on, any operation containing that floating point value would also result in a floating point value, even floor division.</p>
<p>Following that, we can perform any additive operations. Once again, we can add parentheses as appropriate to find the following:</p>
<p>
<span class="math align-center">$$ (-2) + 2 - 0.0 $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ ((-2) + 2) - 0.0 $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ (((-2) + 2) - 0.0) $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ (0 - 0.0) $$</span>

<span class="math align-center">$$ 0.0 $$</span></p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve calculated all of the operations on the right-hand side of the assignment operator, we can then perform the assignment operation. Since we used the <code>+=</code> assignment operator, we will add the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0.0 $</span> to the existing value in <code>x</code>. So, we&rsquo;d calculate 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 + 0.0 = 2.0 $</span>, which will store the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2.0 $</span> in <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>So, the final output from this program would be:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/2.6.p.3.ops.png" alt="Operators Example"></p>
<p>Notice that the final type of <code>x</code> is now <code>float</code>, since we added a floating point value to the original <code>int</code> value.</p>
<p>However, as any good math teacher will tell us, it is always better to use additional parentheses to make sure our operations are performed in the correct order instead of relying on the order of operations. So, we should definitely avoid writing code as ambiguous as the example given above.</p>
<p>Human readable code is the goal of any programming activity.</p>

<h1>Command-Line Arguments</h1>
<!-- TODO Simplify? -->
<p>The Linux command line consists of the command and the arguments.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/P_cmdlnarg_1.png" alt="linux command line for python"></p>
<p>In our case the command, the word Linux translates into action, is &ldquo;python3&rdquo;. Everything else is packaged up as string-values and sent to the Python3 interpreter.</p>
<h2 id="python-interpreter-and-the-command-line-arguments">Python Interpreter and the Command-line Arguments</h2>
<p>The Python3 interpreter does different things based on what it receives from Linux as arguments.   If it receives no arguments it starts the Python3 Read-Evaluate-PrintLine (REPL). This is an interactive session of Python3 which can be exited with the command <code>quit()</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/P_interpret.png" alt="Python3 interpreter"></p>
<p><code>python3 -h</code>  brings up all the various options for using the command <code>python3</code>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Notice towards the bottom &ldquo;file  : program read from script file&rdquo;.  This is the way you will typically use the <code>python3</code> command in CC 210.</p>

<p>Inside the Python3 interpreter, the command line arguments are mapped (assigned) to a special variable in the <code>sys</code> module called <code>sys.argv</code><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. <code>sys.argv</code> is a <b>list</b> of <b>strings</b>.</p>

<p>In many languages, <code>argv</code> is essentially read-only, it cannot be altered. This allows multiple files of a complex program to access to the command-line arguments with the assurance that they have not been altered by some other code.  Unfortunately, Python does not really support the idea of constant (unchangeable) user defined data.  So BY CONVENTION, no class method should ever assign to <code>sys.argv</code> or its aliases:</p>

        <tr><td> x &larr; args[0]</td><td> OK, `args` can appear on the Right Hand side of an assignment</td></tr>
        <tr><td> ars[0] &larr; "new string"</td><td> BAD, `args` <b>should never</b> appear on the Left Hand side of an assignment</td></tr>

<h4 id="accessing-arguments">Accessing arguments</h4>
<p><code>args[0]</code> is <b>always</b> the name of the file being run.  Additional command line arguments are space (tab) separated.  <code>args</code> is always a list of strings, in the order they appeared on the command line.</p>

<h1>Subgoals - Evaluating Expressions</h1>
<p>One of the unique parts of this course will be the inclusion of subgoals to help us better understand what is going on in our code. Subgoals are designed to help us structure our thinking process in a way that matches what an experienced developer might have.</p>
<p>A great example is learning how to read. Fluent readers can read whole words at a time, while processing and retaining information from several sentences at once. Novice readers have to sound out words one letter at a time, and can store and retain a few words at a time in memory before being overwhelmed by information. Learning a new language can quickly make this difference very apparent, even for readers who are fluent in many languages.</p>
<p>Writing computer code is very similar. An experienced developer can fluently read and write code, seeing and understanding entire code structures at a glance. Novice developers often have to look at a single line at a time, and break it down into individual parts before it is apparent what the code says. That&rsquo;s just part of the learning process!</p>
<p>To make this process easier, this course will include many pages that describe subgoals we can use to help analyze and write code. In essence, we can treat these subgoals as a set of steps to follow mentally when performing these tasks. Over time, we&rsquo;ll become more comfortable with each task, and the subgoals will quickly become ingrained knowledge. Just like we can easily read both &ldquo;cat&rdquo; and &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo; at a glance, with practice we&rsquo;ll be able to read code just as quickly!</p>

<h2 id="analyzing-expressions">Analyzing Expressions</h2>
<p>To analyze an expression involving variables and mathematical operators in code, here are some mental subgoals we can use:</p>
<h3 id="1-check-types">1. Check Types</h3>
<p>First, we must determine whether the data type of the expression is compatible with the data type of the variable we want to store it in. In Python, we can generally store any value in any variable, since the interpreter will change the type of the variable as needed behind the scenes.</p>
<h3 id="2-solve-arithmetic-equation">2. Solve Arithmetic Equation</h3>
<p>At this point, we can solve the arithmetic equation using the order of operations for our language. This simply involves the process of substituting values for variables and performing the requested operations. However, once again we must be careful to make sure that the operands provided to each operator are valid and produce the desired data type. The example we saw earlier for handling a large equation showed us a great way to work through this process.</p>
<h3 id="3-confirm-data-type-of-result--store-it">3. Confirm Data Type of Result &amp; Store It</h3>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve solved the arithmetic equation, we should be left with a variable on the left side of the equals sign and a single value on the right side. So, once again, we should confirm that the value on the right can be stored in the data type of the variable on the left.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through an example showing how to use these subgoals to evaluate a few expression statements.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We&rsquo;ll break this down by subgoals:</p>
<ol>
<li>We see that the values on the right side of the equation are integers, which can definitely be added together. So, this expression will store an integer value in <code>x</code>.</li>
<li>We can now solve the arithmetic equation on the right side of the expression. So, we can easily find that <code>3 + 5</code> can be replaced with <code>8</code>.</li>
<li>This tells us to once again confirm that the result is a compatible value for the data type of the variable on the left. Since <code>8</code> can be stored in any variable, we are just fine. So, we can update the value of <code>x</code> to <code>8</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it! While this may seem like quite a bit of information for handling a simple statement, it becomes much more useful as the statements get more complex.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a second example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3.5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span>y
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once again, let&rsquo;s break the last line in this code example down by subgoals to evaluate the expression:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is a bit tricky, since the statement includes several variables. However, we can look at the earlier code to see that <code>x</code> is an integer type, and <code>y</code> is a floating point type. Since this expression is adding them together, the result should be a floating point number, which can be stored back in the variable <code>z</code>. So, we should be fine here.</li>
<li>Now we can solve the equations. To do this, we&rsquo;ll replace each variable with its value, then calculate the result. So, <code>x + -y</code> becomes <code>5 + -3.5</code> which results in <code>1.5</code>.</li>
<li>Once we have the result, we must confirm that it can be stored in the variable to the left. Since <code>1.5</code> is a floating point number, it can be stored in the variable <code>z</code> without any problems. So, we&rsquo;ll update the value of <code>z</code> to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1.5 $</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, at the end of this short code example, we&rsquo;ll see that <code>x</code> is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span>, <code>y</code> is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 3.5 $</span>, and <code>z</code> is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1.5 $</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s look at one more example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">8.5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> z
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here&rsquo;s how we can break down the process of evaluating the last line in this example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Looking at the last line, we see that there is the value <code>3</code> on the left side of the equals sign <code>=</code>. This is not allowed in Python, so the Python interpreter will give us an error when we try to execute this code. So, we can stop here.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we can see, by carefully following these subgoals, we can even find errors in our code, just by evaluating it step by step.</p>

<h1>Subgoals - Writing Expressions</h1>
<p>We can also use subgoals to help us write new expressions in our code. These subgoals help us understand each part of the process of building a new expression, and they also help us avoid many common errors.</p>
<h2 id="writing-expressions">Writing Expressions</h2>
<p>Here are the subgoals for writing a new expression:</p>
<h3 id="1-find-variable-in-problem-statement">1. Find Variable in Problem Statement</h3>
<p>The first step is to determine which part of the problem statement will be represented by a variable. Sometimes this is obvious, and other times it is not. This may be a new variable that we are creating, or it could be an update to an existing variable.</p>
<h3 id="2-determine-name-and-data-type-of-variable">2. Determine Name and Data Type of Variable</h3>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve found a variable to work with, we must also determine the variable&rsquo;s name and data type. Once again, this may be obviously found in the problem statement, but other times we must think a bit more about what type of data will be stored in the variable. Of course, we should also make sure the variable has a descriptive and memorable name if we are creating a new one.</p>
<h3 id="3-build-arithmetic-equation-with-operators">3. Build Arithmetic Equation with Operators</h3>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve isolated our variable, we must build an arithmetic equation and operators required to produce the desired value. This may involve using additional variables in our equations as well.</p>
<h3 id="4-build-expression">4. Build Expression</h3>
<p>Once we have our arithmetic equation, we can then build the overall expression. This usually consists of three parts: the variable on the left, an assignment operator in the middle, and the arithmetic equation on the right.</p>
<h3 id="5-make-sure-operators-and-operands-are-compatible">5. Make sure Operators and Operands are Compatible</h3>
<p>Finally, once we&rsquo;ve constructed the overall expression, we should check and make sure that all operators and operands are compatible. This means making sure we are using the correct operators and conversions to produce the desired data type as output.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick example to show how this process works. Consider the following problem statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given two whole numbers as command line inputs, find the remainder of dividing the first number by the second number.  The command line would be <code>python3 Types.py 2 3</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use the subgoals listed above to build an expression for this problem statement</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we must identify our variables. Looking at this problem statement, we see that it expects us to be given two whole numbers. So, we&rsquo;ll probably need two integer variables to represent those two numbers. Then, we&rsquo;ll need a third variable to store the remainder. In total, we can easily identify three variables that we&rsquo;ll need to create for this program.</li>
<li>Next, we must determine the name and type of each of these variables. To make it very clear, I&rsquo;m going to label the two input variables <code>inputA</code> and <code>inputB</code>, and the remainder variable <code>remainder</code>. We can also determine that each of them should be integers, since we are only dealing with whole numbers. So, our code might begin with these three variable declarations:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>inputA <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> args[<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>]

<li>But <code>args</code> is a list of Strings so we need to convert inputs into integers.</li>

</span></span></code></pre></div><ol start="4">
<li>Now we can assemble our arithmetic equation. We need to calculate the remainder of dividing <code>inputA</code> by <code>inputB</code>, so we can use the modulo operation <code>%</code> to find this value. So, our arithmetic equation could be <code>intA % intB</code>.</li>
<li>Then, we can build the overall expression itself. Since we want to store the result of the arithmetic equation in <code>remainder</code>, we&rsquo;ll build the line <code>remainder = intA % intB</code> as our entire expression. So, we can add that to our code:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>inputA <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> args[<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>]

</span></span></code></pre></div><ol start="5">
<li>Finally, we must make sure our operators and operands are all compatible. Since we know that both <code>intA</code> and <code>intB</code> are integers, the result of the modulo operation would also be an integer. So, this line is valid.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using these subgoals is a very great way to learn how to build programs one step at a time. As we learn more about programming and get more experience, many of these steps will become automatic. This is very similar to how we write sentences by hand. We typically don&rsquo;t think about each letter as we write it once we are fluent with the language, but instead we think of entire words and our brain is able to send the correct commands to produce the desired output. With time and practice, writing code will be very similar.</p>

<h1>Printing Text &amp; Numbers</h1>
<h2 id="printing-text-with-variables">Printing Text with Variables</h2>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve learned how to run our program and provide it some input, we must also learn how to provide output that includes our variables as well as text all on the same line. There are a few ways to accomplish this.</p>
<p>First, we can use <code>print(&quot;text&quot;, end=&quot;&quot;)</code> to print text without a newline character at the end, so that the next output will begin on the same line. So, we could use that to print text and variables on the same line. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Variable x: &#34;</span>, end<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(x, end<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;, Variable y: &#34;</span>, end<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(y)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>will produce this output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Variable x: 1, Variable y: 2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In Python, we can also provide multiple arguments to the <code>print()</code> method, and it will print each one in order, separated by a space. So, we could produce similar output using this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Variable x:&#34;</span>, x, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;, Variable y: &#34;</span>, y)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>which should output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Variable x: 1 , Variable y: 2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that there is an extra space after <code>1</code> in the output. This is because Python automatically adds a space between each argument provided to the <code>print()</code> method. So, we must be careful about our formatting using this method.</p>
<p>We can also use the <code>format()</code> method in Python to include many variables in a single piece of text. We&rsquo;ll cover more about the <code>format()</code> method in a later chapter, but here&rsquo;s an example of how it could be used to create the desired output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 1
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 2
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">print</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Variable x: {}, Variable y: {}&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">format</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>x<span style="color:#f92672">,</span> y<span style="color:#f92672">))</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Inside of the text, we use curly brackets <code>{}</code> to denote where to place the variables. Then, we place a <code>.format</code> directly after the text, and inside of that method call we provide the variables we&rsquo;d like to include in the text. The variables are included in the respective order they are given, so, in this example, <code>x</code> will be placed where the first curly braces <code>{}</code> are, and <code>y</code> will be placed where the second curly braces are.</p>
<p>When we run this program, it will output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Variable x: 1, Variable y: 2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Other languages allow us to use the plus <code>+</code> operator to <em>concatenate</em>, or join, two pieces of text together. Python also includes this feature, but it is much more restrictive. Let&rsquo;s look at an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Variable x: &#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;, Variable y: &#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> y)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we try to run this program, we will get the following error:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/02-data/implicit.py.png" alt="Python Implicit Conversion Error"></p>
<p>That seems strange, doesn&rsquo;t it? It turns out that the Python interpreter tries its best to interpret whether the plus symbol should be used for addition and concatenation. Since the first operand is text, it assumes we&rsquo;d like to do concatenation. However, the second operand is <code>x</code>, which is an <code>int</code> variable. Python does not automatically convert numerical variables to text (denoted as type <code>str</code>, short for <em>String</em>), and it doesn&rsquo;t know how to concatenate text and a number together. So, it gives us an error.</p>
<p>To resolve this problem, we must convert our numerical variables to text, using the <code>str()</code> method to <em>cast</em> those variables to the <code>str</code> data type. So, we must modify the example above to resemble this one:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Variable x: &#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> str(x) <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;, Variable y: &#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> str(y))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>which will now output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Variable x: 1, Variable y: 2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There are many ways that we can use Python to output text and variables as desired. We&rsquo;ll use some of these methods to complete this project.</p>
