    <title>OOP Features :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/01-object-oriented-programming/04-features-of-oop/</link>
    <description>In this course, we will be teaching programming from the object-oriented perspective. Both Java and Python support this programming paradigm, and it is commonly used in industry today. However, it is easier to understand some of these concepts (such as classes and objects), after first covering some of the fundamental concepts.&#xA;Thus, the first few modules of this course will contains some pieces of starter code that we’ll use without really explaining much about how they work, but rest assured that we’ll cover those concepts at the correct time in the course.</description>
