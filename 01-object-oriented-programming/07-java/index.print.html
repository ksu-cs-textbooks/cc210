<p>The Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems starting in the early 1990s as <em>Oak</em>, a new programming language designed to build upon the ideas of C++. Oak would be object-oriented and include a garbage collector, both things that were seen as weak points of the C++ language at that time. In addition, it would be designed to be portable across many different types of devices.</p>
<p>Eventually, the language was renamed to <em>Java</em>, and was originally used develop applications that could run on a website. These Java <em>applets</em> for the web were very popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but most of them have since been replaced by JavaScript code that can run directly in the web browser.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Java vs. JavaScript</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>While Java and JavaScript may share a common-sounding name, they are in fact completely unrelated languages. JavaScript was originally named <em>Mocha</em> and then <em>LiveScript</em>, but was rebranded to JavaScript in 1995. That move was widely regarded as a marketing ploy to take advantage of the fact that Java was the most popular new language at the time.</p>
<p>In fact, today JavaScript is just one of many implementations of a language standard known as <em>ECMAScript</em>. However, the name confusion still exists.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Since that time, Java has grown into its own fully-fledged programming language, and has indeed met its goal of being highly portable. Java today can run on most major computer operating systems through the use of the <em>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</em> and <em>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</em>. In addition, the Android mobile operating system uses the Java programming language, and it has been used on many web servers and in consumer electronics.</p>
<p>For software developers, the <em>Java Development Kit (JDK)</em> provides easy access to all of the tools needed to develop programs using the Java language. Once a program is developed, the Java compiler converts the program to <em>Java bytecode</em>, which is similar to machine-code. That Java bytecode can then be run on any compatible platform using the JVM. This allows Java to achieve true portability. The only part of the system that must be specific to the computer&rsquo;s hardware and operating system is the JVM, while Java bytecode can be used on any system with a compatible JVM installed.</p>
<p>Today, the OpenJDK project handles all development of the Java platform, and the language and all supporting code is free and open source.</p>
<p>If none of these features in the history of Java make any sense at this point, that&rsquo;s OK! It&rsquo;s difficult to describe the differences between programming languages without getting technical. However, that is a good thing for us, since nearly every programming language can be used to create the programs we&rsquo;ll be writing in this course. The differences aren&rsquo;t really important at this point!</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered the basics, let&rsquo;s get right down to it and create our first program in Java!</p>

<p>According to tradition, the first computer program that we cover in any language is a simple program called &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; The entire goal of the program is to demonstrate what it takes to create our first program from scratch in the language and get to the point where we can print the message of our choice to the screen. While that sounds very simple, it is actually a pretty big first step toward learning how to write our own programs. Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>

  <div class="box-content">

<p>If this is your first-time programming, it can be quite daunting to know where to get started. This guide will walk you through all the steps to create your first program. However, if you have any questions at all, don&rsquo;t be afraid to seek help. It&rsquo;s much easier to answer questions up front when they come up, instead of dealing with them down the road when you are truly lost.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="some-terminology">Some Terminology</h2>
<p>In any programming language, there is a bit of terminology that we should discuss before diving in. Here are a few terms we&rsquo;ll want to be familiar with at this point:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>keyword</strong> - in any programming language, a <em>keyword</em> is a word that has a special meaning. These words tell the program exactly what to do, and we cannot use these words as <em>identifiers</em>. Consult the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html" target="_blank">Java Language Keywords</a>
 list to determine which words are keywords in Java.</li>
<li><strong>identifier</strong> - any class, method, or variable name is considered an <em>identifier</em>.</li>
<li><strong>declaration</strong> - in a programming language, we use special lines to <em>declare</em> that something exists. In this example, we&rsquo;ll see both a <em>class declaration</em> and a <em>method declaration</em>.</li>
<li><strong>body</strong> - following a declaration, we typically find the <em>body</em> of the declared item. The body is enclosed by <em>braces</em>.</li>
<li><strong>braces</strong> - in Java, we use <em>braces</em> or <em>curly braces</em>, denoted by <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>, to enclose blocks of code. We&rsquo;ll use these to enclose both the <em>class body</em> and <em>method body</em>.</li>
</ul>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Declaration vs. Definition</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>Formally, a <strong>Declaration</strong> associates an identifier with a program language element.</p>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>A <strong>Definition</strong> includes the complete information about the program element.  So for a class, a definition includes its body.</p>

However, Java does not support this style of coding.  As a result, Java documentation and developers tend to use &ldquo;declaration&rdquo; for both declaration and definition.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="open-a-file">Open a File</h2>
<p>To begin, we&rsquo;ll write our code in a file name <code>HelloWorld.java</code>. If this lesson is being done in Codio or another learning environment, that file may already be open. If not, click on that file in the file tree to the far left to open it. Make sure that file is open for this example, since the file name must match in order for this process to work properly.</p>
<p>Also, we should make sure that the file is completely empty before moving on. If there is any text currently in that file, take the time to delete it now.</p>
<p>We can also do these same steps on a computer with the Java Development Kit installed. Simply create a new, blank text file named <code>HelloWorld.java</code>.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-class">Create a Class</h2>
<p>Java is an <em>object-oriented</em> programming language. We&rsquo;ll discuss this more in detail in a later module, but for now we&rsquo;ll just need to know that Java requires all of our code to be placed in a <code>class</code>. So, at the very top of our file, we&rsquo;ll enter the following line:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">HelloWorld</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>That line called a <em>class declaration</em> in Java. Let&rsquo;s break that line down and discuss what each part means:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>public</code> - this keyword is used to identify that the item after it should be publicly accessible to all other parts of the program. In a later module, we&rsquo;ll talk about these keywords, called <em>access modifiers</em>, and the impact they have on our programs. For now, we&rsquo;ll just use <code>public</code> whenever we need an access modifier, such as in a class declaration.</li>
<li><code>class</code> - this keyword says that we are declaring a new class.</li>
<li><code>HelloWorld</code> - this is an identifier that gives us the name of the class we are declaring. Java requires that the class name matches the filename that it is stored in, so we must store the <code>HelloWorld</code> class in a file named <code>HelloWorld.java</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every Java program must contain at least one class declaration. In fact, each Java file we create will contain at least on class declaration, so we&rsquo;ll see this structure repeated very often.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle note">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Too Much Information?</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>Unfortunately, when learning to program in Java, there are a few things that we&rsquo;ll just have to take for granted for now until we learn a bit more about how they actually work. Class declarations are a great example of this. For the next several modules, we&rsquo;ll just have to include a class declaration at the top of each file without understanding everything about them. As long as we make sure the identifier matches the name of the file, it should work just fine. In fact, in most of the later examples in this book, we&rsquo;ll have some sample code in each file that includes the class declaration.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re covering it in detail here just to make sure it is clear what is going on at first. It&rsquo;s always better to have too much information than not enough.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="class-body">Class Body</h2>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve completed our class declaration, we need to move on to the <em>class body</em>. The class body is where all of the information about the class is stored. In Java, we use <em>braces</em> to enclose a block of code, such as a body. So, let&rsquo;s modify our file to look like the following example by adding an <em>opening brace</em> <code>{</code> and a <em>closing brace</em> <code>}</code> with a few empty lines in between. Instead of copy-pasting it, try to type it in yourself and see what happens!</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">HelloWorld</span> <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Did you notice that the text editor automatically added a closing brace right after you typed the opening brace? That&rsquo;s the power of using a text editor that is tailored for programming. It should have also indented all of the lines between the two braces a bit, making it easier to read your code as we continue to fill it in. It may seem a bit jarring a first, but you&rsquo;ll quickly get used to it. We&rsquo;ll see it happen again later in this example.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Style Guide</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>To make your code easier to read, many textbooks and companies use a <em>style guide</em> that defines some of the formatting rules that you should follow in your source code. However, this is a point of contention, and many folks disagree over what is the best format. These formatting rules do not affect the actual code itself, only how easy it is to read.</p>
<p>For this book, most of the examples will be presented in a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#K&amp;R_style" target="_blank">K&amp;R Style</a>
 used by most Java developers, which places the opening brace on the same line as the declaration, but the closing brace is placed on a line by itself and indented at the same level as the declaration. The code inside will be indented by four spaces.</p>
<p>Google provides a comprehensive <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html" target="_blank">style guide</a>
 that is recommended reading if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about how to format your source code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="main-method">Main Method</h2>
<p>Inside of our class body, we must create a main method. A <em>method</em> is a piece of code that performs an action in our program. Methods are sometimes referred to as <em>functions</em> or <em>subroutines</em> as well, but we&rsquo;ll use the term <em>method</em>. Each Java program have one class that contains at least one special method, called the <em>main method</em>, that tells the program where to start. So, let&rsquo;s modify our file to the left to look like this example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">HelloWorld</span> <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">static</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>String<span style="color:#f92672">[]</span> args<span style="color:#f92672">){</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>We just added a <em>method declaration</em> and <em>method body</em> to our program! Let&rsquo;s look at some of the keywords we used here:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>public</code> - just like before, we are using the <code>public</code> access modifier to allow any part of our program to access this method.</li>
<li><code>static</code> - the <code>static</code> keyword is one of the more difficult to understand, and even some experienced programmers struggle with it. In this example, we must use <code>static</code> since this is the main method, which must always be a static method. This is because we aren&rsquo;t using this method inside of an object, which we&rsquo;ll cover in a much later module. For now, every method we create will use a <code>static</code> keyword.</li>
<li><code>void</code> - this describes what kind of data this method should output. Since this is the main method, it cannot output anything to another part of the program, so we use the special <code>void</code> keyword to denote the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t output anything. (At least, it doesn&rsquo;t output anything to the rest of the program, but it may display things on the screen!)</li>
<li><code>main</code> - this is another identifier that gives the name of the method. Since our program needs to have at least one main method, we need to use <code>main</code> as the name of this method.</li>
<li><code>(String[] args)</code> - following the method name is a section in parentheses that defines the inputs, or <em>parameters</em>, for the method. The main method must take in one parameter, an array of Strings. By convention, we use the identifier <code>args</code> as the name of that parameter. We&rsquo;ll learn more about parameters, Strings, and arrays, in a later module. For now, we&rsquo;ll just have to remember that the main method must have this exact set of parameters.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly, we included a second set of braces to enclose the method body. Notice how everything in the class body is indented slightly, making it easy to see the structure of the code.</p>
<p>For now, we&rsquo;ll just have to memorize the fact that the main method in Java is declared using <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>. As we move through this book, we&rsquo;ll slowly learn more about each part of that line and what it does, and it will make much more sense.</p>
<h2 id="saying-hello">Saying Hello</h2>
<p>Finally, we can write our code. The actual code of our program goes inside the main method&rsquo;s body, between the two braces. In the classic &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; example, we simply want to print the words &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; to the screen. So, let&rsquo;s modify our program one last time to look like this example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">HelloWorld</span><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">static</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>String<span style="color:#f92672">[]</span> args<span style="color:#f92672">){</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello World&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you typed in that information, you might have noticed that the editor also added a second set of quotation marks <code>&quot;</code>, just like it did with the braces earlier. This is another example of a programmer-friendly text editor at work!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review what we just added to our program:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>System.out.println</code> - this line tells us that we&rsquo;d like to use a method called <code>println</code> in the <code>System.out</code> <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html" target="_blank">PrintStream</a>
 object. Again, that means very little to us right now, but for now we&rsquo;ll need to know to use this method to print a line of text to the screen. Following the name of the method is a set of parentheses that accepts input to the method, which is what we&rsquo;d like to have printed to the screen.</li>
<li><code>&quot;Hello World&quot;</code> - by putting this in the parentheses after <code>System.out.println</code>, we are telling the <code>println</code> method in <code>System.out</code> to print <code>Hello World</code> to the screen. We have to enclose it in quotation marks <code>&quot;</code> so that our program will treat it as a line of text and not more Java code. The values, or variables passed to a method are referred to as the method&rsquo;s <em>parameters</em>.</li>
<li><code>;</code> - each line of code in Java must end with a semicolon <code>;</code>. This helps the compiler determine where one line of code ends and another begins. They really serve the same purpose as the period <code>.</code> in written English. However, periods are already used for other purposes in Java, so the semicolon became the standard symbol for the end of each line of code.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s all it takes to write our first program in Java. On the next page, we&rsquo;ll learn how to actually compile and run this program.</p>

<h4 id="video-script">Video Script</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through the process of writing our first program in Java using Codio.</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;ll need to make sure we have the correct file open. For this example, we are using a file named <code>HelloWorld.java</code>. It should already be open in the panel on the left for us. If not, we can always find it in the file tree to the far left.</p>
<p>To begin, we&rsquo;ll need to create a class inside of this file using a <em>class declaration</em>. So, let&rsquo;s type</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">HelloWorld</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>into the file. The text on this page describes the special words <code>public</code> and <code>class</code> that we&rsquo;ve included in this line and what they mean. They are some of the many <em>keywords</em> in Java, or words which are used to tell the program what to do. Make sure you take the time to read that information carefully.</p>
<p>However, one very important thing to know is that the name of the class, in this case <code>HelloWorld</code>, must be exactly the same as the name of the file it is stored in. So, since our file is named <code>HelloWorld.java</code>, we must create a class named <code>HelloWorld</code> in that file.</p>
<p>Following the <em>class declaration</em>, we must also have a <em>class body</em>. To do this, we use two curly braces <code>{ }</code>. This just tells Java that anything between these two curly braces is considered to be part of the <code>HelloWorld</code> class.</p>
<p>Next, we need to create a <em>main method declaration</em>. This tells our program what code to run when it is first executed. So, let&rsquo;s add the following code to our file</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">static</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>String<span style="color:#f92672">[]</span> args<span style="color:#f92672">){</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once again, you can refer to the text on this page for a longer description of what each of these words mean. We&rsquo;ll see this line of code in every Java program we create, so it&rsquo;ll become very familiar.</p>
<p>Also, we&rsquo;ve used another set of curly braces after the <em>main method declaration</em> to enclose the <em>method body</em>, just like we did for the <em>class body</em> earlier.</p>
<p>Finally, we can add the code to print &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; to the screen:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span>System<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">println</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello World&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">);</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This line tells us to use the <code>println</code> or &ldquo;print line&rdquo; method that is stored in the <code>System.out</code> object in Java. We won&rsquo;t learn much about objects for several chapters, so don&rsquo;t worry about that part right now. We&rsquo;ll be sure to explain it clearly when we get to that point.</p>
<p>For now, we just need to know that anything inside of the parentheses <code>( )</code> will be displayed to the user. Since we want to print out actual text, we also make sure that it is in quotation marks <code>&quot; &quot;</code> so that Java will know that it is meant to be treated as text and not more code.</p>
<p>Finally, notice that this line ends in a semicolon <code>;</code>. Java, as well as many other programming languages, use a semicolon at the end of each line of code. This helps Java read our code a little bit easier, and also helps make our programs easier to understand in case we accidentally delete a line or merge several lines together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all it takes! On the next page, we&rsquo;ll learn how to use the Java compiler to actually compile and run this program. So, when you are ready, click the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button to move on to the next page.</p>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve written our first Java program, we must compile and run the program to see the fruits of our labors. There are many different ways to do so. We&rsquo;ll discuss each of them in detail here.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle note">

  <div class="box-content">

<p>This textbook was written for the Codio learning environment, so many of the steps below will reference features in Codio. However, most integrated development environments (IDEs) also include features to compile and run your code, and you can always do so manually using commands in the terminal for your operating system. If you aren&rsquo;t sure how to get it to work, ask for help!</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="terminal">Terminal</h2>
<p>Codio includes a built-in Linux terminal, which allows us to perform actions directly on a command-line interface just like we would on an actual computer running Linux. We can access the Terminal in many ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Selecting the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, then choosing the <strong>Terminal</strong> option</li>
<li>Pressing SHIFT + ALT + T in any Codio window (you can customize this shortcut in your Codio user preferences)</li>
<li>Pressing the <strong>Open Terminal</strong> icon in the file tree</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, some pages may already open a terminal window for us in the left-hand pane, as this page so helpfully does. As we can see, we&rsquo;re never very far away from a terminal.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the terminal window and navigate to our program. When we first open the Terminal window, it should show us a prompt that looks somewhat like this one:</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-59662da9fcf0df677e403f03d8817560" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.j.3.terminal1.png" alt="Initial Terminal View" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">
</a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox" id="image-59662da9fcf0df677e403f03d8817560">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.j.3.terminal1.png" alt="Initial Terminal View" class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>There is quite a bit of information there, but we&rsquo;re interested in the last little bit of the last line, where it says <code>~/workspace</code>. That is the current directory, or folder, our terminal is looking at, also known as our <em>working directory</em>. We can always find the full location of our working directory by typing the <code>pwd</code> command, short for &ldquo;Print Working Directory,&rdquo; in the terminal. Let&rsquo;s try it now!</p>
<p>Enter this command in the terminal:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>pwd</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and we should see output similar to this:</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-21bf9040213e13dfcae64d2d6c02cf05" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.j.3.pwd.png" alt="pwd Command Output" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">
</a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox" id="image-21bf9040213e13dfcae64d2d6c02cf05">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.j.3.pwd.png" alt="pwd Command Output" class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>In that output, we&rsquo;ll see that the full path to our working directory is <code>/home/codio/workspace</code>. This is the default location for all of our content in Codio, and its where everything shown in the file tree to the far left is stored. When working in Codio, we&rsquo;ll always want to store our work in this directory.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s use the <code>ls</code> command, short for &ldquo;LiSt,&rdquo; to see a list of all of the items in that directory:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>~/workspace<span style="color:#e6db74">$</span> ls</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>java  README.md</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We should see a short list of items appear in the terminal.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>cd</code> command, short for &ldquo;Change Directory,&rdquo; to change the working directory. To change to the <code>java</code> directory, type <code>cd</code> into the terminal window, followed by the name of that directory:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>~/workspace<span style="color:#e6db74">$</span> cd java</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>~/workspace/java<span style="color:#e6db74">$</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>We are now in the <code>java</code> directory, as we can see by observing the <code>~/workspace/java</code> on the current line in the terminal. Finally, we can do the <code>ls</code> command again to see the files in that directory:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>~/workspace/java<span style="color:#e6db74">$</span> ls</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>HelloWorld.java</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We should see our <code>HelloWorld.java</code> file! If it doesn&rsquo;t appear, try using this command to get to the correct directory: <code>cd /home/codio/workspace/java</code>.</p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;re at the point where we can see the <code>HelloWorld.java</code> file, we can move on to actually compiling and running the program.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-in-terminal">Compiling in Terminal</h2>
<p>To compile a Java program in the terminal, we&rsquo;ll use the <code>javac</code> command, short for <em>Java Compiler</em>, followed by the name of the Java file we&rsquo;d like to compile. So, in our case, we&rsquo;ll do the following:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>javac HelloWorld.java</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If it works correctly, we shouldn&rsquo;t get any additional output. The compiler will look through our Java file and create a new file containing the Java bytecode for our program, called <code>HelloWorld.class</code>. We can use the <code>ls</code> command to see it:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>ls</span></span></code></pre></div><p>
<a href="#image-6112a7fc959531a34988d3df4e29ac9a" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/01-oop/1.3.j.3.javac.png" alt="javac Command Output" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">

<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Problems?</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>If the <code>javac</code> command gives you any output, or doesn&rsquo;t create a <code>HelloWorld.class</code> file, that most likely means that your code has an error in it. Go back to the previous page and double-check that the contents of <code>HelloWorld.java</code> exactly match what is shown at the bottom of the page. You can also read the error message output by <code>javac</code> to determine what might be going wrong in your file.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll cover information about simple debugging steps on the next page as well. If you get stuck, now is a great time request help via your course&rsquo;s help system. You aren&rsquo;t in this alone!</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="running-in-terminal">Running in Terminal</h2>
<p>Finally, we can now run our program! Once it is compiled, just type the following in the terminal to run it:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>java HelloWorld</span></span></code></pre></div><p>
<a href="#image-36dff30af4eb7722dbe7ba13813169a5" class="lightbox-link">

</a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it! We&rsquo;ve now successfully compiled and run our first Java program. Of course, we can run the program as many times as we want by repeating the previous <code>java</code> command. If we make changes to the <code>HelloWorld.java</code> file, we&rsquo;ll need to recompile it using the previous <code>javac</code> command first. Then, if those changes instruct the computer to do something different, we should see those changes when we run the program after compiling it.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle tip">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Try It!</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>See if you can change the <code>HelloWorld.java</code> file to print out a different message. Once you&rsquo;ve changed it, use the <code>javac</code> and <code>java</code> commands to compile and run the updated program. Make sure you see the correct output!</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="codio-assessments">Codio Assessments</h2>
<p>Last, but not least, many of the Codio tutorials and projects in this program will include assessments that we must solve by writing code. Codio can then automatically run the program and check for specific things, such as the correct output, in order to give us a grade. For most of these questions, we&rsquo;ll be able to make changes to our code as many times as we&rsquo;d like to get the correct answer.</p>

<h4 id="resources">Resources</h4>
<h4 id="video-script">Video Script</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review how to compile and run a program written in Java using Codio. There are several ways we can accomplish this task.</p>
<p>First, we can always use the built-in Linux Terminal to compile and run any programs we create. In fact, we could follow very similar steps to compile and run Java code on just about any computer!</p>
<p>In Codio, there are several ways to access the Terminal. We can go to the <strong>Tools</strong> menu and find it there. Or, we can press <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> anytime to open it using a keyboard shortcut. Finally, we can always click on the Terminal icon at the top of the filetree. In addition, most of the Codio books and projects in this course will have an <strong>Open Terminal</strong> option available on the <strong>Run Menu</strong> as well. So, there are lots of ways we can get to the Terminal, so take your pick.</p>
<p>On the Terminal itself, we should review a few basic Linux commands that will help us get around the filesystem. If you are completely new to Linux, there is another video on this page that gives a great overview of the Linux Terminal and how to use it.</p>
<p>First, we can always find our current location by using the <code>pwd</code> command. That stands for &ldquo;present working directory&rdquo;, and should give you output similar to this. In our case, we are in the &ldquo;home&rdquo; folder, then inside the &ldquo;codio&rdquo; folder, and finally the &ldquo;workspace&rdquo; folder. That is the default location where all of our code is stored in Codio, so we&rsquo;ll always start in that folder.</p>
<p>To see the files and folders inside that folder, we can use the <code>ls</code> command. It is short for &ldquo;list&rdquo; and it will give us a list of all of the things inside of our present working directory. When we are in the Codio tutorials, we&rsquo;ll see folders here for each chapter. So, we&rsquo;ll need to open the folder for our current chapter. You can find the folder for the current chapter in the filetree to the far left of the screen.</p>
<p>So, to enter that folder, we&rsquo;ll use <code>cd</code> followed by the name of the folder we&rsquo;d like to open. In this case, we&rsquo;ll do <code>cd 1j-hello</code>.</p>
<p>Once we are in that folder, we can do <code>ls</code> once again to see the files it contains. We should hopefully see <code>HelloWorld.java</code> there. If so, we can move on.</p>
<p>Before we can run our Java programs, we have to compile the code into a format that the computer can understand. So, we&rsquo;ll use the Java Compiler to perform that action. In the Terminal, we can type <code>javac HelloWorld.java</code> to compile our program. If everything works correctly, there won&rsquo;t be any output. However, we can use the <code>ls</code> command again, and we should now see a new file called <code>HelloWorld.class</code>. That is the Java bytecode for our program.</p>
<p>If that file isn&rsquo;t created, or the Java Compiler gives you any output, that probably means that you have a problem in your <code>HelloWorld.java</code> file. To fix it, go back to the previous page and see if you can correct the error. You can also refer to the next page for some tips on how to fix common errors in your code.</p>
<p>Finally, if everything worked correctly, we can type <code>java HelloWorld</code> to run our program. Hopefully we should see the expected output from our program appear on the Terminal!</p>
<p>Codio also includes some shortcuts for compiling and running programs. Most of the resources in this class will include these options, so feel free to use them anytime.</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;ll need to make sure we have our <code>HelloWorld.java</code> source file open. Then, we can click on the <strong>Run Menu</strong>, which is here at the top of the screen, and select the appropriate options there. If we need to compile our program, we can choose <strong>Java - Compile File</strong> first. We should see Codio open a Terminal window, and it will automatically fill in the appropriate command. They look a bit different than the command we learned earlier, mainly because these commands include the folder path directly in the command.</p>
<p>Then, we can go back to our file, and choose <strong>Java - Run File</strong> to execute the code we just compiled. Pretty simple, right?</p>
<p>Many Codio lessons also include short assessments that help check your code and make sure it is working correctly. Whenever you see one, you&rsquo;ll want to take the time and make sure you are able to complete the assessment successfully before you move on. They are a great way to check and make sure you understand what the lesson is about. Also, these assessments are used to generate your grade on the tutorial assignments. So, make sure you take a minute and complete the assessments before moving on!</p>

<p>Of course, when developing a computer program, there are always times when things don&rsquo;t quite work the way we&rsquo;d like them to. Let&rsquo;s review a few of the common errors and how to solve them.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-issues">Compiler Issues</h2>
<p>The Java Compiler is usually the source of most of our woes when first learning how to write programs in Java. The compiler expects the source code to be correctly formatted, or else it won&rsquo;t be able to generate the Java bytecode for our program. Let&rsquo;s modify our <code>HelloWorld.java</code> file to include some errors, just to see exactly what the error messages from the compiler are like.</p>
<h3 id="missing-braces">Missing Braces</h3>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s replace everything in <code>HelloWorld.java</code> with the following code:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">HelloWorld</span><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>

<p>Before compiling that program, can you spot the error? Being able to find errors in code without using a compiler will definitely help you develop programs much faster. It is just like being able to spell words correctly without using a spell-checker. It makes everything go just a bit more smoothly.</p>
<p>In each of the examples in this section, take a minute and see if you can spot the error before running it through the compiler. The quiz in this module includes a few questions that require you to spot the error in a piece of code, so this is great practice for later!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve updated that file, we can compile it using the using the terminal. When we do, we should see output similar to this:</p>
<p>

</a></p>
<p>That error message gives us quite a bit of information. The first part, <code>java/HelloWorld.java</code> tells us which file the error is in, which is handy later on when we start working in programs that include multiple source code files. Following that, we see a <code>7</code> after the file name, which tells us that the error is on or around line 7. However, that doesn&rsquo;t always mean that we&rsquo;ll need to edit something at line 7 to fix the error; it just means that the Java Compiler realized there was an error when it reached line 7. Sometimes, we must make a change elsewhere in the file to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>After that, we&rsquo;ll see the actual error message, which in this case is <code>error: reached end of file while parsing</code>. That may not seem very helpful at first, but it actually gives us an important clue.</p>
<p>If we look at the code above, we&rsquo;ll notice that it is missing the second closing brace <code>}</code> at the end of the file. So, the compiler was expecting to see one more closing brace, but didn&rsquo;t find it. So, to fix that, we&rsquo;ll just need to add one more closing brace at the end of the file, and it should work just fine.</p>
<h3 id="missing-semicolon">Missing Semicolon</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example we can try:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">HelloWorld</span><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we try to compile this file, we should get output similar to the following:</p>
<p>

<p>In this example, the output is really helpful. It clearly shows us exactly where in our code we forgot to include a semicolon. By adding that symbol where indicated, we can solve the problem.</p>
<h2 id="runtime-issues">Runtime Issues</h2>
<p>Of course, there are some problems that the compiler may not catch. These are known as <em>runtime errors</em>, since they happen at the <em>time</em> we <em>run</em> our programs. They can be especially tricky to deal with, but thankfully they are usually quite rare.</p>
<h3 id="incorrect-main-method">Incorrect Main Method</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at one more example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">HelloWorld</span><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This time, the program actually compiles! However, when we try to actually run the file, we&rsquo;ll get an error similar to this one:</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-dd0b1fe1f43cde5f2f913a9e640e2c21" class="lightbox-link">

</a></p>
<p>This is because we accidentally forgot the square brackets <code>[]</code> in the main method declaration. It should be <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>, as the error message so helpfully tells us. So, it is important to remember that our programs may still have errors, even if the compiler doesn&rsquo;t find any.</p>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve learned a bit about how to debug compiler errors, let&rsquo;s see if you can figure out how to cause one! Modify <code>HelloWorld.java</code> in a way that causes the compiler to output the following error message:</p>
<p><code>error: class WrongClass is public, should be declared in a file named WrongClass.java</code></p>

<h4 id="video-script">Video Script</h4>
<p>One of the major frustrations when learning to write computer code is dealing with errors in your code. So, let&rsquo;s review a few common mistakes that you may encounter and how to solve them.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at this simple program. See if you can spot the error!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to compile this program and see what output we get from the Java Compiler.</p>
<p>In this case, it tells us that it reached the end of the file while parsing. That means that it was looking for a particular symbol but couldn&rsquo;t find it. So, we need to carefully check our code, looking particularly for missing parentheses, curly braces, or quotation marks. In this case, we left out one of the last curly braces. So, we can add that back in, try to compile our program again, and it should work.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example. What is the error in this code?</p>
<p>Once again, the compiler will give us a helpful error message. This one is pretty easy - it not only tells us what we are missing, but where it needs to be placed in our code. So, we can make that quick fix and we&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s look at an example of a runtime issue in Java. These are errors that won&rsquo;t be caught by the Java Compiler, but they&rsquo;ll cause problems when we try to execute our program. Here&rsquo;s the code we are starting with.</p>
<p>When we compile that code, it seems to work just fine. However, when we run the code, we get this error.</p>
<p>If we look at the code, we&rsquo;ll see that we left off the square brackets in the main method declaration. So, we can make that change, recompile our code, and it should work.</p>
<p>Of course, anytime you run into an error in your code, you should take some time to see if you can solve it yourself. If you really get stuck, don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help on Piazza. Especially when you are learning to code, there is a great chance that you&rsquo;ll run into an error that is difficult to solve by yourself, but we&rsquo;re always available to help!</p>
<p>Good luck completing this rest of this module!</p>
