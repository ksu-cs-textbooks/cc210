Computer technology has some quite a long way since the 1950s, but the same needs that drove the development of compilers and interpreters continue today to drive the development of more advanced programming languages and related tools.">

<p>We&rsquo;ve now written our first program in a real, high-level programming language. While the program may only consist of a few lines of code at most, it is still a very big step toward writing bigger and more advanced programs.</p>
<p>Computer technology has some quite a long way since the 1950s, but the same needs that drove the development of compilers and interpreters continue today to drive the development of more advanced programming languages and related tools. It&rsquo;s a very exciting field to experience firsthand, and once we understand a bit of code, we&rsquo;ll be able to see it for ourselves.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we&rsquo;ll dive in head first to learn all about how to store and manipulate various types of data in our programs.</p>
