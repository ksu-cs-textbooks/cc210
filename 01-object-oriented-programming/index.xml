      <description>As with any learning adventure, we must begin somewhere. When learning how to write computer programs, one of the best questions to tackle first is &amp;ldquo;what is programming?&amp;rdquo; As it turns out, the answer to that question is key to understanding exactly what it is we are trying to learn.
A Simple Computer Video Materials
At its core, a computer is simply an electronic device that is capable of following instructions to perform calculations.</description>

      <description>Modern computers share many theoretical similarities with the Turing Machine, but in practice they are much more advanced. In this section, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how a modern computer is able to run programs we&amp;rsquo;ve written in a high-level programming language like Java or Python.
Programming Languages are Rosetta Stones A programming language, along with the associated compiler or interpreter, is a complete set of tools to write and translate instructions written in that language into the binary code that a computer&amp;rsquo;s central processing unit (CPU) can natively execute.</description>

      <description>Another big idea in computer programming is the software development lifecycle. There are many different ways to approach developing a large computer program, but most of them can be divided into a few clear steps, as shown in this diagram.
Requirements The first step is the requirements analysis phase. In this phase, a software developer works to clearly describe and understand the problem to solve and the features that the solution should have.</description>

      <description>In this course, we will be teaching programming from the object-oriented perspective. Both Java and Python support this programming paradigm, and it is commonly used in industry today. However, it is easier to understand some of these concepts (such as classes and objects), after first covering some of the fundamental concepts.
Thus, the first few modules of this course will contains some pieces of starter code that we&amp;rsquo;ll use without really explaining much about how they work, but rest assured that we&amp;rsquo;ll cover those concepts at the correct time in the course.</description>

      <description>When writing code in an object-oriented language, many times we must use some additional syntax and structures in our programs that are required by the language, even though they aren&amp;rsquo;t strictly required for the program we are trying to develop.
In this section, we&amp;rsquo;ll briefly discuss some of those limitations. Later on in this course, we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to these concepts and explain them more fully, but for now we&amp;rsquo;ll provide some of this structure as starter code for the first few modules.</description>

      <title>Hello World</title>

      <description>Tradition dictates that the first program in any introduction course is Hello World. Hello World simply prints the text &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; to the screen.
Below is an example of an object-oriented version of this program in both Java and Python:
// Java public class HelloWorld{ public static void main(String[] args){ System.out.println(&amp;#34;Hello World&amp;#34;); } } # Python class HelloWorld: @classmethod def main(): print(&amp;#34;Hello World&amp;#34;) HelloWorld.main() In each program, the actual work is done by the line containing the word print.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve now written our first program in a real, high-level programming language. While the program may only consist of a few lines of code at most, it is still a very big step toward writing bigger and more advanced programs.
Computer technology has some quite a long way since the 1950s, but the same needs that drove the development of compilers and interpreters continue today to drive the development of more advanced programming languages and related tools.</description>
