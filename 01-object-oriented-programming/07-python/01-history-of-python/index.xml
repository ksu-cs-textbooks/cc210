    <description>1&#xA;Python was originally developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language used at the research lab where he worked. Some initial goals of this language were to be able to interface with the Amoeba operating system and to include functions for exception handling.&#xA;Guido &amp; Monty According to the official Python FAQ, Python was named in honor of Monty Pythonâ€™s Flying Circus, as Guido van Rossum was reading scripts from the TV show while he was originally implementing parts of Python.</description>
