Python was originally developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language used at the research lab where he worked. Some initial goals of this language were to be able to interface with the Amoeba operating system and to include functions for exception handling.
Guido &amp; Monty According to the official Python FAQ, Python was named in honor of Monty Python’s Flying Circus, as Guido van Rossum was reading scripts from the TV show while he was originally implementing parts of Python.">

Python was originally developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language used at the research lab where he worked. Some initial goals of this language were to be able to interface with the Amoeba operating system and to include functions for exception handling.

<p>According to the official Python FAQ, Python was named in honor of <em>Monty Python&rsquo;s Flying Circus</em>, as Guido van Rossum was reading scripts from the TV show while he was originally implementing parts of Python. He needed a &ldquo;short, unique, and slightly mysterious&rdquo; name, so it stuck.</p>
<p>The Python community for years referred to van Rossum as &ldquo;Benevolent Dictator for Life&rdquo; (BDFL) to denote his place as lead developer, a role from which he stepped down in 2018.</p>

<p>Several initial versions of Python were released throughout the 1990s, but a major update came with the release of Python 2.0 in 2000. Much of the existing Python code base is written for Python 2.X. However, the Python Software Foundation stopped supporting Python 2.X in December 2019.</p>
<p>Python 3, was released in 2008, is the current supported version.  It includes several structural changes to the language that made it incompatible with earlier versions. There are some automated tools available to translate Python 2 code to Python 3.</p>
<p>Python is a multi-paradigm approach. It includes features from object-oriented programming, functional programming, and more.</p>
<p>In this course, we&rsquo;ll deal exclusively with Python 3. As such, we&rsquo;ll need to be careful to use the correct Python 3 documentation and interpreter, or else we may have issues. We&rsquo;ll discuss this a bit more fully later in this module.</p>
<p>If none of these features in the history of Python make any sense at this point, that&rsquo;s OK! It&rsquo;s difficult to describe the differences between programming languages without getting technical. However, that is a good thing for us, since nearly every programming language can be used to create the programs we&rsquo;ll be writing in this course. The differences aren&rsquo;t really important at this point!</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered the basics, let&rsquo;s get right down to it and create our first program in Python!</p>
