    <meta name="description" content="Modern computers share many theoretical similarities with the Turing Machine, but in practice they are much more advanced. In this section, we’ll discuss how a modern computer is able to run programs we’ve written in a high-level programming language like Java or Python.
Programming Languages are Rosetta Stones A programming language, along with the associated compiler or interpreter, is a complete set of tools to write and translate instructions written in that language into the binary code that a computer’s central processing unit (CPU) can natively execute.">

<p>Modern computers share many theoretical similarities with the Turing Machine, but in practice they are much more advanced. In this section, we&rsquo;ll discuss how a modern computer is able to run programs we&rsquo;ve written in a high-level programming language like Java or Python.</p>

<p>A programming language, along with the associated compiler or interpreter, is a complete set of tools to write and translate instructions written in that language into the binary code that a computer&rsquo;s central processing unit (CPU) can natively execute.</p>
<p>Both Java and Python do this by producing an intermediate representation (byte code) then translating that to machine code. In Java&rsquo;s case this byte code is saved as a <code>class</code> file, but usually the Python interpreter does not store the byte code.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-a05ce207023537e2bc394341df70e564" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Simplified View of Computer Execution" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.1.Translation.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Computer central processing units (CPU) <b>exclusively</b> run machine code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Learning to program requires some basic understanding of how a computer works. In the most basic sense, a computer has a large amount of memory connected to a central processing unit (CPU). The memory consists of many bytes of data, each containing eight binary values (e.g. 01001101).</p>
<p>The memory itself is split into various regions, with different regions storing the machine code instructions that make up a program and the data that the program is operating on.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-6bf0b3551775cbd9879303c009ae0aef" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Simplified View of Computer Architecture" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.1_comp_architecture.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-6bf0b3551775cbd9879303c009ae0aef"><img alt="Simplified View of Computer Architecture" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.1_comp_architecture.png"></a></p>
<p>The CPU contains enough circuitry to interpret the instructions it is given and perform the requested mathematical and logical operations on the data provided.</p>
<p>Consider a single line of code in a program:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">z = 5 + 7</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In most languages, a line similar to this will instruct the computer add the values of 5 and 7 and save the value into a variable named <code>z</code>, which will be stored in some location in memory. In a machine language, this single line of code may be actually require different instructions to complete. The table below shows one possible interpretation of that line of code into machine language.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Instruction</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>LVal eax, 0x01A0</code></td>
<td>Load the value found at memory loc <code>0x01A0</code> into CPU register <code>eax</code> <br>This is where <code>5</code> is stored</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>LVal ebx, 0x01A8</code></td>
<td>Load the value found at memory loc <code>0x01A8</code> into CPU register <code>ebx</code> <br>This is where <code>7</code> is stored</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Add eax, ebx</code></td>
<td>Add the values in CPU registers <code>eax</code> and <code>ebx</code> together and store the result back into <code>eax</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Mov eax, 0x01B0</code></td>
<td>Move the value in CPU register <code>eax</code> to memory location <code>0x01B0</code> <br>This is where the variable <code>z</code> is stored</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Machine language is pretty ugly, but this is really how a CPU functions. Thankfully, we have many higher-level programming languages available, such as Java and Python, so we usually don&rsquo;t have to write code directly in machine language.</p>
<h2 id="estimating-program-state">Estimating Program State</h2>
<p>From this, we can come up with a pretty powerful <strong>abstraction</strong> that represents how a computer works.  In programming, an abstraction is a simplified model of a complex system, keeping only the most important details to make using the model easy.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-8b404f44dc41247c2692530b585b643f" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Elements of Program State" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.1_program_state.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-8b404f44dc41247c2692530b585b643f"><img alt="Elements of Program State" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/01-oop/1.1.1_program_state.png"></a></p>
<p>In our abstract model of a computer, we see that a program consists of an ordered list of instructions to be executed, and memory is a set of labelled boxes that can store any data our program requires. We also have a pointer that keeps track of which instruction the computer is currently executing. The list of instructions, the instruction pointer, and the memory combined all make up a <strong>program&rsquo;s state</strong> when it is running on a computer. Tools such as <a href="https://pythontutor.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Python Tutor</a> or <a href="https://pythontutor.com/java.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Java Tutor</a> use a model very similar to this to help us understand how our programs actually work.</p>
