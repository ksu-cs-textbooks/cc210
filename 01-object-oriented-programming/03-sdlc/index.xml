    <title>The Software Development Lifecycle :: CC 210 Textbook</title>

    <description>Another big idea in computer programming is the software development lifecycle. There are many different ways to approach developing a large computer program, but most of them can be divided into a few clear steps, as shown in this diagram.&#xA;Requirements The first step is the requirements analysis phase. In this phase, a software developer works to clearly describe and understand the problem to solve and the features that the solution should have.</description>
