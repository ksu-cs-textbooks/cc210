    <title>Program Structure :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/01-object-oriented-programming/05-structure-oop/</link>
    <description>When writing code in an object-oriented language, many times we must use some additional syntax and structures in our programs that are required by the language, even though they aren’t strictly required for the program we are trying to develop.&#xA;In this section, we’ll briefly discuss some of those limitations. Later on in this course, we’ll come back to these concepts and explain them more fully, but for now we’ll provide some of this structure as starter code for the first few modules.</description>
