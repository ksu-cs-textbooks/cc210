<h1 id="view">View</h1>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s look at the <em>view</em> portion of MVC Architecture. In essence, this part is responsible for displaying data to the user, and in most cases it also handles requesting and receiving input from the user.</p>
<p>One important thing to remember is that the view <strong>should not</strong> duplicate or store any data that is already present in the model. While it may be tempting to store a copy of the currently displayed data in the view, it technically violates the MVC Architecture. We should <em>only</em> store data in the view that is unique to the view, while all data related to the state of the model should be stored in the model instead.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Going back to our Connect Four example, we would probably want our view to be responsible for displaying the current state of the game board, and which player&rsquo;s turn it is, to the player. In addition, it should have methods for retrieving input from the player about what moves to make. Finally, it should have a method to display a message to the players once the end of a game is reached.</p>
<p>So, one way we could represent the view portion of this program is shown in the UML diagram below:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-6671b1f192ffcda86f3285b9c68d963d" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Connect Four View UML Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/14-mvc/13.5.viewuml.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-6671b1f192ffcda86f3285b9c68d963d"><img alt="Connect Four View UML Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/14-mvc/13.5.viewuml.png"></a></p>
<p>In this diagram, we notice that the view itself does not store any attributes at all. This is because the view doesn&rsquo;t have to manage any internal state when it is simply reading data from and writing to the terminal. If we were dealing with a file or a graphical user interface (GUI), then the view may have to store those items as attributes. In this program, we are keeping it pretty simple.</p>
<p>However, the <code>ConnectView</code> class includes several methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ConnectView()</code>: a simple constructor.</li>
<li><code>showBoard(board)</code>: this method will show the current board to the players on the terminal.</li>
<li><code>showTurn(player)</code>: this will display a message letting the players know which player is up next.</li>
<li><code>showMenu()</code>: this method will show the menu of options to the current player, allowing them to make a move. The input received from the player will be sent to the controller.</li>
<li><code>showEndGame(winner)</code>: if either player wins, this will display that message to the terminal.</li>
<li><code>showError(error)</code>: this method is used by the controller to display any errors from the model to the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, the view portion of MVC Architecture mainly deals with displaying messages to the user, and then prompting the user for input. It doesn&rsquo;t have to store any data to be useful, and doesn&rsquo;t even include a direct link to the model. That is provided by the controller, which we&rsquo;ll learn about next.</p>
