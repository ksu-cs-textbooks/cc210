    <title>Model :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/14-mvc/05-model/</link>
    <description>The first part of MVC Architecture is the model. Roughly speaking, the model represents all data stored by the program. However, beyond just data, the model should also include all methods that are used to directly modify the data stored in the model. This could also include code that represents or enforces the “rules” around how the model can be manipulated.&#xA;It can sometimes be tricky to determine exactly which components of the program should be included in each part, but the model is usually the most straightforward one to work with.</description>
