    <title>Controller :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/14-mvc/07-controller/</link>
    <description>The final part of MVC architecture is the controller. The controller is really the “glue” that brings together the different parts of the model and the view, building a cohesive program. Traditionally, the controller contains the main() method of the program, and acts as the starting point for everything else the program does.&#xA;It can be tempting to think of the controller as the “brains” of the program. However, if we are careful about properly building methods in the model that enforce the rules of the program, as well as methods in the view that are able to validate any input received from the user, the controller itself may not have much logic at all in it.</description>
