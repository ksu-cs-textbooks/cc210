    <title>MVP - A Type of MVC :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/14-mvc/04-mvp-type/</link>
    <description>Technically, what we are going to implement is Model-View-Presenter, MVP. MVP is a specialization of the MVC design pattern which enforces strict architectural separation between the elements and makes the View solely responsible for handling all the user interface (input and output).&#xA;Under strict layering, architectural layers can only interact with adjacent layers. This can make the initial coding a little cumbersome.&#xA;The advantage of this strict layering is it allows you to “swap parts”.</description>
