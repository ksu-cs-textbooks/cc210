If you prefer formality you can call me Mrs. Alfs-Votipka. Either is fine with me.\nIf you have any questions related to course content, please email the CC 210 help email shown here in the syllabus. If you have any non-course related questions for me, you can email me on my personal email. That’s just emilyalfs@ksu.edu. Though for course things it is best to use the CC 210 help.\nOkay, so when you start the course, you’ll see something like this, you’ll see this splash page, obviously, for Python, you’ll see Python here, and there will be a Python graphic, you can also look at the announcements, there is this announcement for the potential to be dropped for non participation. And you can read that in your own time. So what you’ll need to do is make sure that you complete Module Zero to be considered participating in the course.\nSo in the course, we have all of these modules, and again, right now I’m looking at the Java specific, but this is very similar to the Python, you’ll see we have all of these modules. And you can collapse them all if you like. And then just expand the one that you’re working on. Or you can have them all expanded if you want as well.\nWe also have the syllabus that you can go to, this has all of the contact information. I would like to add at this point, um, I will be adding office hours, I am not certain on what times those will be I do teach some in person classes. So I’m going to try and fit those around that schedule. And also, if you are not in Manhattan or not near campus, I will offer some online components for meetings. And that will typically be through my Calendly. If you’re concerned about that, please do feel free to reach out. And we can coordinate something.\nI highly recommend that you read through the syllabus. One key thing is the late work policy is is very important that you don’t get behind. So if you do feel like you’re getting off track, then please feel free to reach out and I’ll help to get you back on to the right track. The policy is that the grade will be reduced by 10% of the total points per day that it’s late. So if it’s due Thursday at midnight, and you turn it in, say Friday afternoon, then you will lose 10% of the points. That’ll be automatically assessed by Canvas. But that penalty won’t show up in codio. So Canvas is the official source for your grades and what will end up being your final grade. So if anything seems off or out of whack in Canvas, please reach out and let me know.\nAt the bottom of this page, we have this Course Summary. So this course summary is handy to kind of get a broad picture of what’s due when. I have all of the due dates currently set up in Canvas. Another way that you can be aware of what’s coming up what you need to do, there is this to do list on the right hand side. And that will tell you similar to that course summary what is due and the precise time that it’s due.\nAnother thing you can do is view the course calendar. And here you can also see everything that will be due for a particular day. Again, I have all of the due dates mapped out and such. So your calendar should stay relatively the same as what you see here. That’s all for this first announcements video.\nSo go ahead and get started on the course content. And please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I’m happy to help and student success is important to me. So if there’s anything that you see that you feel like could be done better or differently, please let me know please reach out. I’m happy to help and to integrate new tools or techniques into the course to help make it a better course overall\n",

    "content": " YouTube Video Resources Slides Previous Versions Video Script [Slide 1]\nHello and welcome to the Computational Core program!\nMy name is Emily Alfs-Votipka, and I’ll be one of the instructors for this program. My contact information is shown here, and is also listed on the syllabus.\n[Slide 2]\nThere are many other instructors and TAs for this program that you may interact with or see in the tutorial videos. They all have been instrumental in the development of this program.\n[Slide 3]\nIn this course we will primarily use a K-State email group (cc110-help or cc110-help@ksuemailprod.onmicrosoft.com) to communicate. Email sent to this address is forwarded to all instructors and TAs. Our replies to you will also be shared amongst the instructors and TAs so we all have access to the assistance you have already received. We will respond to you within a business day So a question emailed Friday night may not receive an answer before Monday.\nIf you wish to pose a discussion topic to you classmates, you should use the discussion feature in Canvas. Please note that asking a question on a discussion forum is not the same as emailing cc110-help; we will certainly monitor the discussion channels, but not with the same speed as the “help line”. Please read and adhere to the guidance on Netiquette in the syllabus for all electronic communications.\n[Slide 4]\nIn addition to email and Canvas, we’ll be using the online learning platform Codio for most of the programming tutorials and projects in this program. We’ll also discuss how to use Codio later in this module.\n[Slide 5]\nThe Computational Core program consists of several courses, and each course contains a number of learning modules. There are about 30 modules in this course. Each module will usually consist of some lecture material and quizzes, and there are a few modules which include a programming component. The modules themselves are gated, which means that you must complete each item in the module in order before continuing. In addition, the modules enforce prerequisite requirements from other modules. For CC 110 you must complete them in order starting with module 0, the enroll module should be completed first, but is not a prerequisite.\nYou are welcome to work on this course at any time during the week as your schedule allows, provided that you complete each module before the listed due date. There will be roughly two modules due each week. The modules are self-contained, and nearly all of the grading in this course is completed automatically through Canvas and Codio. So, you can complete modules at any time before the due date, and once a module is complete, you may immediately start on the next one.\n[Slide 6]\nLooking ahead to the rest of this introductory module, you’ll see that there are a few more items to be completed before you can move on. In the next video, we’ll discuss a bit more information about navigating through this course on Canvas and using the Codio learning environment.\n[Slide 7]\nOne thing we highly encourage each of you to do is read the syllabus for this course in its entirety, and let us know if you have any questions. My view is that the syllabus is a contract between me as your teacher and you as a student, defining how each of us should treat each other and what we should expect from each other. We have made a few changes to the standard syllabus template for this program, and those changes are clearly highlighted. Finally, the syllabus itself is subject to change as needed as we adapt this program to meet the needs of its students, and all changes will be clearly communicated to everyone before they take effect.\n[Slide 7]\nOne very important part of the syllabus that every student should read is the late work policy. First off, each module has a due date, and you may work on that module at any time before it is due, provided you have met the prerequisites. As discussed before, you must do all the readings and assignments in a module in listed order before moving on, so you cannot jump ahead. A module is considered completed when all items have been completed.\nFor the purposes of grading, we will use the date and time that the confirmation quiz was submitted at the end of each module to determine when the module was completed. This is due to the way that Codio handles automated grading, as it may resubmit previously graded assignments if an error in the module is corrected, making a previously completed assignment appear to be submitted late.\nIf any work is submitted after the due date, a penalty of 10% of the total points possible in that assignment will be deducted for each day it is late, up to a maximum of 3 days. After 3 days beyond the due date, you will receive a 0 on the assignment. Please refer to the full late policy in the syllabus for more information about how late work is handled in this course.\nFinally, even if a module is late, it still must be completed before you can move on to a later module. So, it is very important to avoid getting behind in this course, as it can be very difficult to get back on track. If you ever find that you are struggling to keep up, please don’t be afraid to contact either the instructors or GTAs for assistance. We’d be happy to help you get caught back up quickly.\nIn this program, the standard “90-80-70-60” grading scale will apply, though I reserve the right to curve grades up to a higher grade level at my discretion. Therefore, you will never be required to get higher than 90% for an A, but you may get an A if you score slightly below 90% if I choose to curve the grades.\nThis is intended to be a completely online, self-paced course. There are no mandatory scheduled course times. All of the content is available online, so you can work whenever and wherever you want. It could be a 3-hour block once a week, or a few minutes here and there between classes. It’s really up to you and your schedule. However, remember that each module may require 4 to 6 or more hours of work to complete, so make sure you have plenty of time available to devote to this course.\nAlso, a vast majority of the grading in this course will be handled automatically through Canvas and Codio. This means that you’ll be able to receive feedback directly from those systems as soon as you submit your work. You may also contact the instructors and GTAs for additional tips and feedback regarding your work, but depending on the number of students in the program, we may not be able to review every student submission directly.\nIn addition, due to the flexible online format of this class, there won’t be any long lecture videos to watch. Instead, each module will consist of a guided tutorial and several short videos, each focused on a particular topic or task. Likewise, there won’t be any textbooks required, since all of the information will be presented in the interactive tutorials through Codio. Finally, since we are using Codio as our learning platform, you won’t have to deal with installing and using a clunky integrated development environment, or IDE, just to learn how to program. Codio helps make learning to program quick and painless by moving everything to the web.\nFor this course, the only supplies you’ll need as a student are access to a modern web browser and a broadband internet connection. No other special hardware or software is necessary!\nFinally, as you are aware, this course is always subject to change. This is a relatively new program here at K-State, and we’re always working on new and interesting ideas to integrate into the courses. The best advice I have is to look upon this graphic with the words “Don’t Panic” written in large, friendly letters. If you find yourself falling behind, or not understanding seek our help via cc110-help.\nSo, to complete this module, there are a few other things that you’ll need to do. The next step is to watch the video on navigating Canvas and Codio, which will give you a good idea of how to most effectively work through the content in this course.\nTo get to that video, click the “Next” button at the bottom right of this page.\n",

    "content": "1\nThe Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems starting in the early 1990s as Oak, a new programming language designed to build upon the ideas of C++. Oak would be object-oriented and include a garbage collector, both things that were seen as weak points of the C++ language at that time. In addition, it would be designed to be portable across many different types of devices.\nEventually, the language was renamed to Java, and was originally used develop applications that could run on a website. These Java applets for the web were very popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but most of them have since been replaced by JavaScript code that can run directly in the web browser.\nJava vs. JavaScript While Java and JavaScript may share a common-sounding name, they are in fact completely unrelated languages. JavaScript was originally named Mocha and then LiveScript, but was rebranded to JavaScript in 1995. That move was widely regarded as a marketing ploy to take advantage of the fact that Java was the most popular new language at the time.\nIn fact, today JavaScript is just one of many implementations of a language standard known as ECMAScript. However, the name confusion still exists.\nSince that time, Java has grown into its own fully-fledged programming language, and has indeed met its goal of being highly portable. Java today can run on most major computer operating systems through the use of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In addition, the Android mobile operating system uses the Java programming language, and it has been used on many web servers and in consumer electronics.\nFor software developers, the Java Development Kit (JDK) provides easy access to all of the tools needed to develop programs using the Java language. Once a program is developed, the Java compiler converts the program to Java bytecode, which is similar to machine-code. That Java bytecode can then be run on any compatible platform using the JVM. This allows Java to achieve true portability. The only part of the system that must be specific to the computer’s hardware and operating system is the JVM, while Java bytecode can be used on any system with a compatible JVM installed.\nToday, the OpenJDK project handles all development of the Java platform, and the language and all supporting code is free and open source.\nIf none of these features in the history of Java make any sense at this point, that’s OK! It’s difficult to describe the differences between programming languages without getting technical. However, that is a good thing for us, since nearly every programming language can be used to create the programs we’ll be writing in this course. The differences aren’t really important at this point!\nNow that we’ve covered the basics, let’s get right down to it and create our first program in Java!\nResources Java Homepage OpenJDK Java Documentation File:Java_programming_language_logo.svg.

Some initial goals of this language were to be able to interface with the Amoeba operating system and to include functions for exception handling.\nGuido \u0026 Monty According to the official Python FAQ, Python was named in honor of Monty Python’s Flying Circus, as Guido van Rossum was reading scripts from the TV show while he was originally implementing parts of Python. He needed a “short, unique, and slightly mysterious” name, so it stuck.\nThe Python community for years referred to van Rossum as “Benevolent Dictator for Life” (BDFL) to denote his place as lead developer, a role from which he stepped down in 2018.\nSeveral initial versions of Python were released throughout the 1990s, but a major update came with the release of Python 2.0 in 2000. Much of the existing Python code base is written for Python 2.X. However, the Python Software Foundation stopped supporting Python 2.X in December 2019.\nPython 3, was released in 2008, is the current supported version. It includes several structural changes to the language that made it incompatible with earlier versions. There are some automated tools available to translate Python 2 code to Python 3.\nPython is a multi-paradigm approach. It includes features from object-oriented programming, functional programming, and more.\nIn this course, we’ll deal exclusively with Python 3. As such, we’ll need to be careful to use the correct Python 3 documentation and interpreter, or else we may have issues. We’ll discuss this a bit more fully later in this module.\nIf none of these features in the history of Python make any sense at this point, that’s OK!

That tree can be described by its width, height, age, number of leaves, and even its color or texture. What about a person? A person has a name, age, height, and many other attributes. Could we simply represent trees, humans, and other entities in our computer programs using their attributes?\nThat’s the next big step in learning how to write a computer program: dealing with data. Many of the programs we’ll write are simply built to help us manipulate data in some fashion. Think back to the Turing Machine example from the first chapter. All a Turing Machine does is manipulate data on a tape, and it is capable of running any possible computer program.\nIn this chapter, we’ll learn all about the different ways we can work with data in our programs.\nImage Credit: geralt on pixabay https://pixabay.com/en/binary-code-globe-africa-asia-1695475/ ↩︎\n",

    "content": "The Java programming language is a explicit statically typed language. This means that each and every variable we use in our programs must be declared with a name and a type before we can use it. The Java compiler can then perform a step known as type checking, which verifies that we are using the proper data types in our program.\nThe major advantage of this approach is that many errors in our computer programs can be discovered by the compiler, well before we ever try to run the program directly. It can also help us determine what the cause of the error is by stating that it is a type error, giving us a clue toward how it could be solved.\nOne downside to this approach is that it makes our programs a bit more complex, as we must think ahead about what types of data we’ll be storing in each variable, and we’ll need to write our programs carefully to avoid type errors. However, it may also make our programs easier to manage later on, as we’ll know exactly what type of data is stored in each variable at any given point in the program’s execution.\nTo make dealing with types a bit easier, Java will automatically coerce data from a “narrower” data type to a “wider” data type without any additional code. For example, an integer in Java can be stored in a floating point variable.\nHowever, the opposite case is not true. In Java, we cannot store a floating point number in an integer without explicitly converting the data type. We’ll see how to do that later in this chapter.\n",

    "content": "The Python programming language is a dynamically typed language. This means that a variable in our programs can store any type of data at any time, and we can even use the same variable to store different data types at different times in the same program. When we attempt to access the data stored in our variable, the Python interpreter determines if the data type of the variable can be used for that operation.\nThe major advantage of this approach is that it is very quick and easy to build programs in this language without worrying about the types of data that may be used. We could be storing integers, floating point numbers, or any other data type, and we won’t have to change the variables we are using in our program.\nThe biggest downside to this approach is that it can be a bit more difficult to debug errors in our programs related to data types. While any variable can store any type, we must still make sure that we are using the correct types of data in each operation. In Python, the interpreter will only give us an error when we try to use a variable with an invalid data type stored inside it.\nTo make dealing with types a bit easier, when dealing with mixed integer-float math, Python will automatically convert the integer into a float type without any additional code. For example, an integer in Python can be treated as a floating point number, since a floating point number has a larger size than an integer.\nHowever, the opposite case is not true. In Python, we cannot treat a floating point number as an integer without explicitly converting the data type. We’ll see how to do that later in this chapter.\n",

When learning how to write computer programs, one of the best questions to tackle first is “what is programming?” As it turns out, the answer to that question is key to understanding exactly what it is we are trying to learn.\nA Simple Computer YouTube Video\nVideo Materials\nAt its core, a computer is simply an electronic device that is capable of following instructions to perform calculations. In computer science theory, there is a special kind of theoretical computer called a Turing Machine that represents the simplest version of a modern computer. It might look something like this, as imagined by an artist:\n1\nA Turing Machine consists of an infinitely long tape that can be used to store data, and a small control box that manipulates the tape. The control box knows how to perform a few simple instructions, such as “Move Left” or “Write 0.” So, to program a Turing Machine, we must simply tell the control box which instructions to follow, and it can do it. For example, if we want the Turing Machine to write “101” on the tape, we could write the following program:\nWrite 1 Move Right Write 0 Move Right Write 1 Stop Seems simple enough. We won’t go into the details here, but computer scientists have been able to prove that any computer program that can run on a real computer could also be performed on a Turing Machine, as long as the Turing Machine has infinite time and an infinitely long tape.\nThis video shows an example of what a Turing Machine might look like in real life.\nYouTube Video\nSo, all we really need to learn is how to write programs for a Turing Machine, right?\nA Modern Computer 2\nWell, it’s unfortunately not that simple. There are two major differences between a Turing Machine and a modern computer that we must deal with. First, a modern computer knows many more instructions than a Turing Machine. To learn how to write programs that a modern computer can understand, we’d have to learn an entirely different vocabulary of commands. At the same time, modern computers are very complex systems, so any program we write might not be very efficient at doing what we want.\nSo, to learn how to write computer programs quickly and easily, we really want to be able to do two things:\nUse a vocabulary of commands that are familiar to us Have those commands turn into programs that run efficiently on a modern computer Compilers \u0026 Interpreters to the Rescue! 3\nDeveloping computer programs was very difficult work in the 1950s, and many of those early programmers were looking for a better way to solve that exact problem. One of these was Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, shown above. Her team was one of the first to develop the idea of writing computer programs using English words, and then using a second program, which they called a compiler, to convert those English words into instructions a computer could understand.\nTheir compiler made developing computer programs much simpler, since programmers didn’t have to learn an entirely new vocabulary to tell the computer what to do. Instead programmers simply had to learn the rules of what a computer could and couldn’t understand, and the syntax, or grammar rules, of how the compiler expected the program to be written. These new programming languages that use English words are referred to as high-level languages.\nProgrammers would now write the source code for the program in a high-level language, and then use a compiler to generate the machine code that the computer would actually run. In addition, since the compiler was a program itself, it could make sure the machine code it generated was as fast and efficient as possible, eliminating lots of hard work programmers would have to perform to tailor each program to fit the hardware it was going to run on.\nToday, programming languages such as C, C++, and Java use compilers to convert source code into machine code.\n4\nAt the same time, other developers such as Steve Russell, shown above, were working on another type of program, called an interpreter, to solve the same problem. An interpreter can read source code and immediately tell the computer what steps to perform, without needing to generate the whole machine code first. This makes it much easier to write and edit programs on the fly, as the interpreter reads the source code directly each time the program runs. Today, programming languages such as PHP, JavaScript, and Python use interpreters to run the source code on a computer.\nProgramming So, programming is simply the act of writing computer code in a way that a computer can run it. In most cases today, that means developing the source code for a program in a high-level language, then using either a compiler to generate the machine code for that program, or an interpreter to run the program directly on the computer from the source code. Of course, we can always write machine code by hand, but that is quite a bit more difficult.\nIn this class, we’ll learn how to write source code in one of two common languages, Java and Python. They both have their own unique features, especially since Java is a compiled language and Python is an interpreted language. However, as we saw above with the Turing Machine example, each language can be used to write any computer program. So, the choice of language is really more about personal preference and the unique features of each language than anything else.\nThis makes sense, because in general we can use both English and Spanish, as well as most other languages today, to express the same thoughts and ideas, even if we may not always have a word with the same meaning in both languages.\nFile:Maquina.png.

    "content": " YouTube Video Resources Codio Documentation Video Script This course makes extensive use of several features of Canvas which you may or may not have worked with before. To give you the best experience in this course, this video will briefly describe those features and the best way to access them.\nWhen you first access the course on Canvas, you will be shown this homepage. It contains quick links to the course syllabus and Piazza discussion boards. This is handy if you just need to jump to a particular area.\nLet’s walk through the options in the main menu to the left. The first section is Modules, which is where you’ll primarily interact with the course. You’ll notice that I’ve disabled several of the common menu items in this course, such as Files and Assignments. This is to simplify things for you as students, so you remember that all the course content is available in one place.\nWhen you first arrive at the Modules section, you’ll see all of the content in the course laid out in order. If you like, you can minimize the modules you aren’t working on by clicking the arrow to the left of the module name. I’ll do so, leaving the introductory module open.\nAs you look at each module, you’ll see that it gives quite a bit of information about the course. At the top of each module is an item telling you what parts of the module you must complete to continue. In this case, it says “Complete All Items.” Likewise, the following modules may list a number of prerequisite modules, which you must complete before you can access it.\nWithin each module is a set of items, which must be completed in listed order. Under each item you’ll see information about what you must do in order to complete that item. For many of them, it will simply say view, which means you must view the item at least once to continue. Others may say contribute, submit, or give a minimum score required to continue. For assignments, it also helpfully gives the number of points available, and the due date.\nLet’s click on the first item, Course Introduction, to get started. You’ve already been to this page by this point. Many course pages will consist of an embedded video, followed by links to any resources used or referenced in the video, including the slides and a downloadable version of the video. Finally, a rough video script will be posted on the page for your quick reference.\nWhile I cannot force you to watch each video in its entirety, I highly recommend doing so. The script on the page may not accurately reflect all of the content in the video, nor can it show how to perform some tasks which are purely visual.\nWhen you are ready to move to the next step in a module, click the Next button at the bottom of the page. Canvas will automatically add Next and Previous buttons to each piece of content which is accessed through the Modules section, which makes it very easy to work through the course content. I’ll click through a couple of items here.\nAt any point, you may click on the Modules link in the menu to the left to return to the Modules section of the site. You’ll notice that I’ve viewed the first few items in the first module, so I can access more items here. This is handy if you want to go back and review the content you’ve already seen, or if you leave and want to resume where you left off. Canvas will put green checkmarks to the right of items you’ve completed.\nContinuing down the menu to the left, you’ll find the usual Canvas links to view your grades in the course, as well as a list of fellow students taking the course.\n===\nNow, let’s go back to Canvas and load up one of the Codio projects. To load the first Codio projects, click the Next button at the bottom of this page to go to the next part of this module, which is the Codio Introduction tutorial. On that page, there will be a button to click, which opens Codio in a new browser window or tab.\nOnce Codio loads, it should give you the option to start the Guide for that module. You’ll definitely want to select that option whenever you load a Codio project for the first time.\nFrom there, you can follow the steps in that guide to learn more about the Codio interface. The first page of the guide continues this video. I’ll see you there!\n",

    "content": "Each module in Canvas will usually contain two Codio tutorial assignments. Some weeks may have more; in any event module content must be accomplished in order.\nThe first tutorial is a programming language agnostic discussion of the concept the module introduces. Often this tutorial introduces pseudo code, has questions and may contain a Parsons Puzzle. Most of the questions only allow one attempt, however Parsons Puzzles will allow multiple tries. The second tutorial will contain your language specific implementation of this concept; the syntax (format) and semantics (behavior/meaning) of the specific keywords. This tutorial may include a programming example as well as a programming exercise. In these Codio tutorials, there will be several pages of content introducing the material for that module. Some of the pages will look just like this one, with text, images, and maybe even a short video to help you learn the material.\nIf you’d like to see an outline of the pages available as part of this module, click the “hamburger” menu button at the top-right of the page.\nSome of the pages may also include short questions to check for understanding of the material. You’ll need to answer these questions as they appear in order to get points for completing the tutorial module. Remember that the tutorials make up part of your grade in this course, so make sure you answer all of the questions in the tutorial module before submitting it. In some cases, you’ll be able to resubmit your answers until you get a correct answer, but other questions will not allow that.\nIn fact, below is a quick example of what one of those questions would be like. Take a moment to answer the question correctly, then continue to the next page of this module. For those of you unfamiliar with the work of Douglas Adams, the answer is forty-two.\nWeb Only This content is presented in the course directly through Codio.

While that sounds very simple, it is actually a pretty big first step toward learning how to write our own programs. Let’s get started!\nHelp! If this is your first-time programming, it can be quite daunting to know where to get started. This guide will walk you through all the steps to create your first program. However, if you have any questions at all, don’t be afraid to seek help. It’s much easier to answer questions up front when they come up, instead of dealing with them down the road when you are truly lost.\nIf you are a Kansas State University student, both your syllabus and the course canvas pages will have information on how to requests help, attend office hours, etc.\nSome Terminology In any programming language, there is a bit of terminology that we should discuss before diving in. Here are a few terms we’ll want to be familiar with at this point:\nkeyword - in any programming language, a keyword is a word that has a special meaning. These words tell the program exactly what to do, and we cannot use these words as identifiers. Consult the Java Language Keywords list to determine which words are keywords in Java. identifier - any class, method, or variable name is considered an identifier. declaration - in a programming language, we use special lines to declare that something exists. In this example, we’ll see both a class declaration and a method declaration. body - following a declaration, we typically find the body of the declared item. The body is enclosed by braces. braces - in Java, we use braces or curly braces, denoted by { and }, to enclose blocks of code. We’ll use these to enclose both the class body and method body. Declaration vs. Definition Formally, a Declaration associates an identifier with a program language element.\npublic class Pet; // a declaration // tells the compiler that there will be a class called Pet // Java will not support a class declaration this way A Definition includes the complete information about the program element. So for a class, a definition includes its body.\npublic class Pet { ... some code for the body // a definition // like a declaration with all the info about the class } Some older languages (notably C) allowed things to be declared and used before they were defined. However, Java does not support this style of coding. As a result, Java documentation and developers tend to use “declaration” for both declaration and definition.\nOpen a File To begin, there should see a file named HelloWorld.java open in the panel to the left. If not, click on that file in the file tree to the far left to open it. Make sure that file is open for this example, since the file name must match in order for this process to work properly.\nAlso, we should make sure that the file is completely empty before moving on. If there is any text currently in that file, take the time to delete it now.\nWe can also do these same steps on a computer with the Java Development Kit installed. Simply create a new, blank text file named HelloWorld.java.\nCreate a Class Java is an object-oriented programming language. We’ll discuss this more in detail in a later module, but for now we’ll just need to know that Java requires all of our code to be placed in a class. So, at the very top of our file, we’ll enter the following line:\npublic class HelloWorld That line called a class declaration in Java. Let’s break that line down and discuss what each part means:\npublic - this keyword is used to identify that the item after it should be publicly accessible to all other parts of the program. In a later module, we’ll talk about these keywords, called access modifiers, and the impact they have on our programs. For now, we’ll just use public whenever we need an access modifier, such as in a class declaration. class - this keyword says that we are declaring a new class. HelloWorld - this is an identifier that gives us the name of the class we are declaring. Java requires that the class name matches the filename that it is stored in, so we must store the HelloWorld class in a file named HelloWorld.java. Every Java program must contain at least one class declaration. In fact, each Java file we create will contain at least on class declaration, so we’ll see this structure repeated very often.\nToo Much Information? Unfortunately, when learning to program in Java, there are a few things that we’ll just have to take for granted for now until we learn a bit more about how they actually work. Class declarations are a great example of this. For the next several modules, we’ll just have to include a class declaration at the top of each file without understanding everything about them. As long as we make sure the identifier matches the name of the file, it should work just fine. In fact, in most of the later examples in this book, we’ll have some sample code in each file that includes the class declaration.\nWe’re covering it in detail here just to make sure it is clear what is going on at first. It’s always better to have too much information than not enough.\nClass Body Once we’ve completed our class declaration, we need to move on to the class body. The class body is where all of the information about the class is stored. In Java, we use braces to enclose a block of code, such as a body. So, let’s modify our file to look like the following example by adding an opening brace { and a closing brace } with a few empty lines in between. Instead of copy-pasting it, try to type it in yourself and see what happens!\npublic class HelloWorld { } Did you notice how the editor in Codio automatically added a closing brace right after you typed the opening brace? That’s the power of using a text editor that is tailored for programming. It should have also indented all of the lines between the two braces a bit, making it easier to read your code as we continue to fill it in. It may seem a bit jarring a first, but you’ll quickly get used to it. We’ll see it happen again later in this example.\nStyle Guide To make your code easier to read, many textbooks and companies use a style guide that defines some of the formating rules that you should follow in your source code. However, this is a point of contention, and many folks disagree over what is the best format. These formatting rules do not affect the actual code itself, only how easy it is to read.\nFor this book, most of the examples will be presented in a variant of the K\u0026R Style used by most Java developers, which places the opening brace on the same line as the declaration, but the closing brace is placed on a line by itself and indented at the same level as the declaration. The code inside will be indented by four spaces.\nGoogle provides a comprehensive style guide that is recommended reading if you’d like to learn more about how to format your source code.\nMain Method Inside of our class body, we must create a main method. A method is a piece of code that performs an action in our program. Methods are sometimes referred to as functions or subroutines as well, but we’ll use the term method. Each Java program have one class that contains at least one special method, called the main method, that tells the program where to start. So, let’s modify our file to the left to look like this example:\npublic class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args){ } } We just added a method declaration and method body to our program! Let’s look at some of the keywords we used here:\npublic - just like before, we are using the public access modifier to allow any part of our program to access this method. static - the static keyword is one of the more difficult to understand, and even some experienced programmers struggle with it. In this example, we must use static since this is the main method, which must always be a static method. This is because we aren’t using this method inside of an object, which we’ll cover in a much later module. For now, every method we create will use a static keyword. void - this describes what kind of data this method should output. Since this is the main method, it cannot output anything to another part of the program, so we use the special void keyword to denote the fact that it doesn’t output anything. (At least, it doesn’t output anything to the rest of the program, but it may display things on the screen!) main - this is another identifier that gives the name of the method. Since our program needs to have at least one main method, we need to use main as the name of this method. (String[] args) - following the method name is a section in parentheses that defines the inputs, or parameters, for the method. The main method must take in one parameter, an array of Strings. By convention, we use the identifier args as the name of that parameter. We’ll learn more about parameters, Strings, and arrays, in a later module. For now, we’ll just have to remember that the main method must have this exact set of parameters. Lastly, we included a second set of braces to enclose the method body. Notice how everything in the class body is indented slightly, making it easy to see the structure of the code.\nFor now, we’ll just have to memorize the fact that the main method in Java is declared using public static void main(String[] args). As we move through this book, we’ll slowly learn more about each part of that line and what it does, and it will make much more sense.\nSaying Hello Finally, we can write our code. The actual code of our program goes inside the main method’s body, between the two braces. In the classic “Hello World!” example, we simply want to print the words “Hello World!” to the screen. So, let’s modify our program one last time to look like this example:\npublic class HelloWorld{ public static void main(String[] args){ System.out.println(\"Hello World\"); } } As you typed in that information, you might have noticed that Codio also added a second set of quotation marks \", just like it did with the braces earlier. This is another example of a programmer-friendly text editor at work!\nLet’s review what we just added to our program:\nSystem.out.println - this line tells us that we’d like to use a method called println in the System.out PrintStream object. Again, that means very little to us right now, but for now we’ll need to know to use this method to print a line of text to the screen. Following the name of the method is a set of parentheses that accepts input to the method, which is what we’d like to have printed to the screen. \"Hello World\" - by putting this in the parentheses after System.out.println, we are telling the println method in System.out to print Hello World to the screen. We have to enclose it in quotation marks \" so that our program will treat it as a line of text and not more Java code. The values, or variables passed to a method are referred to as the method’s parameters. ; - each line of code in Java must end with a semicolon ;. This helps the compiler determine where one line of code ends and another begins. They really serve the same purpose as the period . in written English. However, periods are already used for other purposes in Java, so the semicolon became the standard symbol for the end of each line of code. That’s it! That’s all it takes to write our first program in Java. On the next page, we’ll learn how to actually compile and run this program using Codio.\n",

Here are a few terms we’ll want to be familiar with at this point:\nkeyword - in any programming language, a keyword is a word that has a special meaning. These words tell the program exactly what to do, and we cannot use these words as identifiers. Consult the Python Language Keywords list to determine which words are keywords in Python. built in functions - in addition to keyword, Python has a list of built in functions, the names of these functions should be treated as keywords–don’t use them as identifiers. Consult the Python Built in Functions list to determine the names you should avoid. print is a built in function. Open a File To begin, there should see a file named HelloWorld.py open in the panel to the left. If not, click on that file in the file tree to the far left to open it. Make sure that file is open for this example, since the file name must match in order for this process to work properly.\nAlso, we should make sure that the file is completely empty before moving on. If there is any text currently in that file, take the time to delete it now.\nWe can also do these same steps on a computer with Python installed. Simply create a new, blank text file named HelloWorld.py.\nimport sys class HelloWorld: @staticmethod def main(args): ## Your Code goes below ## Your code goes above if __name__ == \"__main__\": HelloWorld.main(sys.argv) Lets take a quick look at the starter code.\nclass HelloWorld: starts the class definition. By convention, class names in Python follow PascalCase, each \"word\", including the first is capitalized and spaces are omitted. Also by convention, the file name and class name are the same. @staticmethod def main(args):def main() starts the definition of the main method. Python convention is that method names (function names) are in camelCase. Object oriented convention is that the main() method is static (more on this about module 10). # WRITE YOUR CODE HEREThrough module 5, you will just be adding code to the main() method. These comments are a guide to help you get the code in the right place. There is no connection between the number of blank lines and the number of lines of code you will need to write. if __name__ == ...By convention, object oriented programs start in the main method, this code accomplishes that. Saying Hello Finally, we can write our code. The remaining code of our program goes right inside the definition of main() . In the classic “Hello World!” example, we simply want to print the words “Hello World!” to the screen. So, let’s add the following code to that file. To fully see how this example works, we should manually type the code into the file instead of copying and pasting it:\nprint(\"Hello World!\") Did you notice how the editor in Codio automatically added a closing parenthesis right after you typed the opening parenthesis? That’s the power of using a text editor that is tailored for programming. It should have also done the same for the quotation marks. It may seem a bit jarring a first, but you’ll quickly get used to it.\nLet’s review what we just added to our program:\nprint - this line tells us that we’d like to use a method called print(), which is a built-in method in Python. That means very little to us right now, but for now we’ll need to know to use this method to print a line of text to the screen. Following the name of the method is a set of parentheses that accepts input to the method, which is what we’d like to have printed to the screen. \"Hello World\" - by putting this in the parentheses after print, we are telling the print() method to print the litteral value Hello World to the screen. We have to enclose it in quotation marks \" so that our program will treat it as a line of text and not more Python code. Style Guide To make your code easier to read, many textbooks and companies use a style guide that defines some of the formating rules that you should follow in your source code. In Python, these rules are very important, as the structure of your code is defined by the layout. We’ll learn more about that in a later module.\nFor this book, most of the examples will be presented using the guidelines in the Style Guide for Python. However, by default Codio used to use 4 spaces for an indentation level instead of 2, so that is the format that will be used in some examples in this book.\nGoogle also provides a comprehensive style guide that is recommended reading if you’d like to learn more about how to format your source code.\nThat’s it!

    "content": " This section introduces Program State, a concept key to understanding how the computer is processing your program. Being able to estimate program state allows us to fix bugs. Programming Languages are Rosetta Stones A programming language is a complete tool set to translate instructions written in one set of symbols to instructions written in machine binary code. Both Java and Python do this by producing an intermediate representation (byte code) then translating that to machine code. In Java’s case this byte code is saved, in Python’s it is not.\nComputer Central Processing Units (CPU) exclusively run machine code.\nIf you are going to learn to program, you need some idea of how a computer works. The most basic view of the computer is a bank of memory connected to a Central Processing Unit (CPU). Each byte in memory has its own unique address and an 8-bit value (eight 0s or 1s : 01001101). This memory is effectively split up into various regions, with instructions in one region and data in another.\nThe CPU has a limited amount of memory (enough to hold a few dozen values) called registers. It also contains all the circuity to interpret the instructions an perform mathematical and logical operations on the values stored in the registers.\nConsider the following program, Z = 5 + 7, which instructs the computer add the values of 5 and 7 and save the value into a variable (memory location). In machine language this many more commands, a simplification might be:\nInstruction Meaning LVal eax, 0x01A0 Load the value found at memory loc 0x01A0 into reg eax This is where “5” is stored LVal ebx, 0x01A8 Load the value found at memory loc 0x01A8 into reg ebx This is where “7” is stored Add eax, ebx Add the values in registers eax and ebx together and store the result back into eax Mov eax, 0x01B0 Move the value in register eax to memory location 0x01B0 This is where the variable Z is stored Pretty ugly, but this is how the CPU gets its instructions.\nEstimating Program State But from this we can come up with a pretty powerful abstraction. In programing, an abstraction is a simplified model of a complex system, keeping only the most important details to make using the model easy.\nOur abstraction will be that a program consists of an ordered list of instructions, a bunch of labeled cubbyholes for data and some pointer that keeps track of which instruction the computer is currently executing. These things, the list of instructions, the current instruction and all the values of all the variables are referred to as a program’s state.\n",

    "content": "Most of the computer programs we’ll write must deal with numbers in some way. So, it makes perfect sense to start working with the numerical data types, since we’ll use them very often. Let’s dive in and see how we can use these numerical data types in Java!\nJava has built in primitive types for various numeric, text and logic values. A variable in Java can refer to either a primitive type or a full fledged object.\nIntegers The first data types we’ll learn about in Java are the ones for storing whole numbers. There are actually 4 different types that can perform this task, each with different characteristics.\nName Type Size Minimum Maximum Byte byte 8 bits $ -128 $ $ 127 $ Short short 16 bits $ -32\\,768 $ $ 32\\,767 $ Integer int 32 bits $ -2\\,147\\,483\\,648 $ $ 2\\,147\\,483\\,647 $ Long long 64 bits $ -2^{63} $ $ 2^{63} - 1 $ As we can see, each data type in this list has a different size, and can store numbers within a different range. So, if we know the minimum and maximum values that could possibly be stored in a particular variable, we can use the smallest corresponding data type that can store that value. This would allow us to conserve the amount of memory used in our programs.\nHowever, in practice, most modern computers have more than enough memory available to handle our programs, so this is typically not a concern for most developers. Instead, it is best to use the largest possible data type, to avoid errors in the future as the program is updated and data values may become larger than initially anticipated.\nIn this program, and most of the code in this book, we’ll typically use the integer, or int data type for all whole numbers. Even though it isn’t the largest data type for storing whole numbers, it is generally large enough. In addition, the int data type is supported universally across many different programming languages, so learning how to use it will make it easier to switch between languages later on.\nFloating Points The next data types we’ll learn about in Java are the ones for storing rational and irrational numbers. There are actually 2 different types that can perform this task, each with different characteristics.\nName Type Size Range Float float 32 bits $ \\pm 10^{\\pm 38} $ Double double 64 bits $ \\pm 10^{\\pm 308} $ Unlike the data types for whole numbers, it is more difficult to discuss the minimum and maximum values for these data types, as it requires a thorough understanding of how they are stored in binary and interpreted by the processor in a computer. In general, each one can handle large numbers as well as small numbers extremely well.\nHowever, just like scientific notation, the numbers it stores at best can only be as accurate as the number of digits it holds. So, when storing an extremely large number, there will be some rounding error.\nIn this program, and most of the code in this book, we’ll typically use the Double, or double data type for all decimal numbers.\nUsing Numbers in Code Now that we’ve discussed the various data types available in Java, let’s look at how we can actually create variables that can store data in our programs.\nGetting Started Before working with the code examples in the rest of this chapter, you’ll need to add a class declaration and a main method declaration to the Types.java file that is open to the left. If you don’t recall how to do that, now is a great time to review the material in Chapter 1 before continuing.\nSetting up a new file each time is great programming practice!\nDeclaring In Java, we can declare a variable using this syntax:\n\u003ctype\u003e \u003cidentifier\u003e; So, to declare a variable of type int named x, we would write:\nint x; We can also do the same for each of the types listed above:\nbyte b; short s; int i; long l; float f; double d; As with any other part of our program, we must first declare it before we can use it.\nIdentifier Rules \u0026 Conventions Java has rules about the allowable names with can be used as identifiers, you can find them in the Java Documentation.\nBy convention, variable names should be descriptive and use camelCase to aid in reading.\nAssigning Once a variable has been declared, we can give it a value using an assignment statement. Assignment uses this syntax:\n\u003cdestination\u003e = \u003cexpression\u003e In that example above, \u003cdestination\u003e is the identifier of the variable we’d like to store data in, and \u003cexpression\u003e is any valid Java expression that produces a value. It could be a number, another variable, a mathematical operation, or even a method call, which we’ll learn about in a later chapter. The variable we are storing the value in must always be on the left side of the equals = sign.\nFor example, if we want to store the value $ 5 $ in an int variable named x, we could write the following:\nint x; x = 5; We can even combine the declaration and assignment statements into a single statement, like this:\nint x = 5; The same syntax applies to all of these types in Java:\nbyte b = 1; short s = 2; int i = 3; long l = 4; float f = 1.2; double d = 3.4; When assigning values from one variable to another using primitive data types, the value is copied in memory. So, changing the value of the first variable would not affect the others, as in this example:\nint x = 5; int y = x; x = 6; At the end of that code, the value of x is $ 6 $, but y still contains $ 5 $. This is important to remember.\nTry It! See if you can create a variable using each of the six data types listed above in Types.java. What happens when you assign a value at that is too big or too small for the variable’s data type? Can you assign the value from an int variable into a byte variable?\nPrinting We can also use the System.out.println and System.out.print methods we learned earlier to output the current value of a variable to the screen. Here’s an example:\nint x = 5; System.out.println(x); Notice that the variable x is not in quotation marks. This way, we’ll be able to print the value stored in the variable x to the screen. If we place it in quotation marks, we’ll just print the letter x instead.\nLater, in the project for this chapter, we’ll learn how to combine multiple variables into a single output.\nCasting When writing our programs, sometimes we need to change the data type that a particular value is stored as, especially when we want to store it in a new variable. Ideally, we would construct our programs to avoid this issue, but in the real world we aren’t always so lucky.\nTo change the data type of a value, we can cast that value to a different data type. To cast a value to a different data type, we put the data type we’d like it to be in parentheses in front of the value.\nLet’s look at the example below:\nint x = 120; byte y = x; System.out.println(y); In this example, we’ve created an int variable x, and stored $ 120 $ in that variable. We then create a byte variable y, and try to store the value from x into y.\nFollow Along Try to run these examples by placing each one in Types.java and seeing what happens. Does it work? Try it before reading the answers below.\nWhen we try to compile that example, we should get the following compiler error:\nSince the int data type is larger than the byte data type, the compiler will give us an error stating that we might lose data when we perform that conversion. Of course, if we reverse the int and byte data types, and try to assign a byte to and int, it will work just fine.\nIn general, we should try to avoid this problem by redesigning our program to eliminate the need to store a variable in a smaller type, but sometimes it is necessary. Do do this, we’ll need to cast the value to the correct data type. Let’s update the example above:\nint x = 120; byte y = (byte) x; System.out.println(y); In this example, we have added a (byte) in front of the variable x when we are assigning it to y. This tells the compiler that we would like to convert the data type of x to byte before storing it in y. Now, when we try to compile and run this program, it will act as we expect.\nHowever, let’s look at one final example to see why the compiler would warn us about converting to a smaller data type:\nint x = 128; byte y = (byte) x; System.out.println(y); Cast vs. Convert When we say “cast” we really mean convert. Sometimes this results in a change in the the binary representation. Conversion preserves the semantics (meaning) but over writes the binary. In addition to the “casting” syntax (desired type) value ... (int)2.0, you will be exposed to many ConvertTo() methods later in this course.\nCasting nearly always preserves the original binary but may result in gibberish; you lose the meaning.\nint x = (int)'2'; // results in x equal to 50 not 2 // '2' binary 00110010 // int value of 00110010 is 50 However, “casting” is nearly always used to mean “convert”. It comes from the origins of programming, where languages supported fewer types and the binary had the same semantic meaning across multiple data types.\ntypebytesbinary for the value of 2 byte100000010 short20000000000000010 int400000000000000000000000000000010 From the above table you can see how casting might work for various sized integer values. Leading “bits” were ignored when casting to a byte-wise smaller type. Leading 0s were added when casting to larger type.\nWe will use cast and convert interchangeably in this course to mean convert to the desired data type. In Java casting between primitive numeric-types often preserves the semantics (value) of the cast. (int) 2.5 is the integer 2, and (double)-4 is the double -4.0.\nIn this example, instead of storing $ 120 $ in x, we have instead stored $ 128 $. When we compile and run this program, we get this unexpected output:\nWe expect it to output $ 128 $, but instead it outputs $ -128 $. That’s strange, isn’t it?\nWhat’s happening is an error known as integer overflow. Since $ 128 $ is too large to fit in a byte variable, the computer will truncate, or remove, the bits that are at the front of the number that won’t fit. This could cause data to be lost or misinterpreted, which is what happens here.\nSo, we must always be careful and not try to cast a variable to a smaller data type if it is too large to fit in that data type. This is why the compiler will always warn us when we try to do so, unless we add an explicit cast to our code.\nSimplify our Code To make things simpler, we typically just use a single data type for whole numbers, and a single data type for decimal numbers. By using the same type consistently throughout our programs, we can avoid many issues related to data types and casting.\nAs stated above, most of the examples in this book will use the int data type for whole numbers, and the double data type for decimal numbers. These choices are consistent with the majority of official Java code.\n",

So, it makes perfect sense to start working with the numerical data types, since we’ll use them very often. Let’s dive in and see how we can use these numerical data types in Python!\nPython has several built-in classes for representing numbers, text and logical values. All Python variables thus refer to full fledged objects.\nIntegers The first data type we’ll learn about in Python is the one for storing whole numbers, called int class. In Python, any whole number without a decimal point is considered to be an int by default, and the only limit on the size of the number is the amount of memory available on our system. So, Python is great at storing even very large numbers!\nFloating Points To store a floating point number in Python, we’ll use the float type. Python uses a 64-bit “double-precision” format to store this number, which is very similar to the double data type in many other languages such as Java. Any literal followed by a decimal, or in scientific notation is interpreted as a float. The table below shows different inferred types for various ways to write one hundred.\nliteral inferred Type 100 int 100. float 1E2 float It is difficult to discuss the minimum and maximum value for this data types, as it requires a thorough understanding of how it is stored in binary and interpreted by the processor in a computer. In general, a float in Python can handle values in the range of $ \\pm 10^{\\pm 308} $.\nHowever, just like scientific notation, the numbers it stores can at best be only as accurate as the number of digits it holds. So, when storing an extremely large number, there will be some rounding error.\nUsing Numbers in Code Now that we’ve discussed the various data types available in Python, let’s look at how we can actually create variables that can store data in our programs.\nCreating a Variable To create a variable in Python, we must simply give it a name and assign it a value, using a syntax similar to this:\n\u003cidentifier\u003e = \u003cexpression\u003e In that example, \u003cidentifier\u003e is any valid identifier that can be used as a variable name in Python, and \u003cexpression\u003e is any valid Python expression that produces a value. It could be a number, another variable, a mathematical operation, or even a method call, which we’ll learn about in a later chapter. The variable we are storing the value in must always be on the left side of the equals = sign.\nIdentifier Rules \u0026 Conventions Python has rules about the allowable names with can be used as identifiers. Basically an identifier can start with any upper or lower case letter, or the underscore _. You may use any combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, underscores and numbers after the first position. The actual rule is located here, but may be a bit too technical at this point.\nBy convention, variable names should be descriptive and use snake_case to aid in reading. Variables starting with the underscore character convey special meanings. Avoid starting with _ for now.\nFor example, if we want to store the integer value $ 5 $ in a variable named x, we could write the following:\nx = 5 The same syntax applies to floating point numbers:\ny = 1.2 When assigning values from one variable to another using primitive data types, the value is copied in memory. So, changing the value of the first variable would not affect the others, as in this example:\nx = 5 y = x x = 6 At the end of that code, the value of x is $ 6 $, but y still contains $ 5 $. This is important to remember.\nTry It! See if you can create a variable using each of the data types listed above in Types.py! Can you find any values that cause errors?\nPrinting We can also use the print method we learned earlier to output the current value of a variable to the screen. Here’s an example:\nx = 5 print(x) Notice that the variable x is not in quotation marks. This way, we’ll be able to print the value stored in the variable x to the screen. If we place it in quotation marks, we’ll just print the letter x instead.\nLater, in the project for this chapter, we’ll learn how to combine multiple variables into a single output.\nDetermining Type Python includes a special method, type(), that can be used to determine the type of a variable. Here’s an example of how it could be used:\nx = 5 y = 1.2 print(type(x)) print(type(y)) Follow Along Try to run these examples by placing each one in Types.py and seeing what happens. Does it work? Try it before reading the answers below.\nWhen we run that program, we should see the following output:\nIn the output, we can see that variable x is of type int, and variable y is of type float. This is exactly as we’d expect, since x is a whole number and y is a rational, or floating point, number.\nCasting When writing our programs, sometimes we need to change the data type that a particular value is stored as, especially when we want to store it in a new variable. Ideally, we would construct our programs to avoid this issue, but in the real world we aren’t always so lucky.\nTo change the data type of a value, we can cast that value to a different data type. To cast a value to a different data type, we can use special methods that are named after each data type.\nLet’s look at the example below:\nx = 1.7 y = int(x) print(y) print(type(y)) In this example, we’ve created a float variable x, and stored $ 1.7 $ in that variable. We then create a new variable y, and convert the value in x to an int before storing it in y, using the int() method. When we run this program, we’ll see the following output:\nAs expected, y is a variable of type int. However, we notice that the value stored in y is $ 1 $. This is because the int() conversion method will truncate, or remove, the decimal portion of the number.\nIn general, we should write our programs carefully so that we avoid ever needing to convert the type of a variable. However, in practice, it is sometimes necessary to do so.\nCast vs. Convert Technically float(), int() and later str() convert their argument (the value in the parentheses) into the appropriate type. Where necessary the binary representation of the is changed. Conversion preserves the semantics (meaning) but over writes the binary.\nCasting using the .cast() method preserves the original binary but may result in gibberish; you lose the meaning.\nHowever, “casting” is nearly always used to mean “convert”. It comes from the origins of programming, where languages supported fewer types and the binary had the same semantic meaning across multiple data types.\ntypebytesbinary for the value of 2 byte100000010 short20000000000000010 int400000000000000000000000000000010 From the above table we can see how casting might work for various sized integer values. Leading “bits” were ignored when casting to a byte-wise smaller type. Leading 0s were adding when casting to larger type.\nWe will use cast and convert interchangeably in this course to mean convert to the desired data type.\n",

    "content": "YouTube Video\nVideo Materials\nFirst, let’s talk about variables. A variable is a placeholder for another value in a computer program. Most students first learn about variables in a mathematics course, such as Algebra. For example, in math, we might see the equation $ x + 5 = 10 $, where $ x $ is a variable, or placeholder, for a value. Using the algebraic rules, we can solve that equation to find that $ x = 5 $.\nVariables in a computer program share some similarities with variables in math, but have some differences as well. First, variables in a computer program are also placeholders that represent a value. However, in programming, instead of representing an unknown value, variables in a computer program represent a stored value, one which we can always access.\n1\nOne way to think about variables in a computer program is to imagine them as a cardboard box. When we declare a variable, we are making a new box and giving it a name, which is the identifier of the variable. In the picture above, we’ve declared a variable named height.\nThen, we can store a value in that variable, using a statement such as height = 42, which will put the number 42 inside of the height variable. This is an assignment statement, which we’ll cover in detail in this chapter.\nLater in our program, we can then access the value stored in that variable and use it for calculations or output. For example, if we have additional variables named width and area, and have already stored the value 10 in width using width = 10, we can calculate the area of rectangular object using a statement such as area = width * height. This would use the current values in the height and width variables, and then store the result in the variable named area.\nBehind the scenes, each time we declare a variable, we are telling the computer to set aside a small piece of memory in which to store something. We give the variable a name when we declare it, and then we can use that name to store or retrieve data from the location in memory our computer gave us.\nUsing variables effectively is a essential to writing good computer programs. This chapter will introduce many of the concepts related to dealing with variables and data in our code.\nOrignial Image Credit: Karen Arnold on Public Domain Pictures.net https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/view-image.php?image=56626\u0026picture=cardboard-box-white-background ↩︎\n",

    "content": "In a computer, all data, even the instructions, is stored in a binary format. Binary data consist entirely of 1s and 0s, or, in the case of a computer, it could be represented as “on” and “off” for current in a circuit, or “positive” and “negative” charges stored on a magnetic storage device. It could even be “open” and “closed” for physical memory gates. There are many different ways to represent it, but it all boils down to just 1s and 0s.\nOf course, we need a way to convert between the binary 1s and 0s that a computer understands and the actual data we’d like to represent. On this page, we’ll cover some of the common types of data and how they are handled by most computer programming languages.\nBinary Working with binary data can be a complex topic. In this program, we won’t deal directly with binary data very often. If you’d like to learn more about the binary numerical system and how it works, check out the Wikipedia article on Binary Numbers.\nYou may also want to review the List of Types of Numbers article as well, since we’ll refer to several of those types.\nBinary literals are often prepended with 0b thus 10 represents the decimal number 10, whereas 0b10 represents the binary number 10 and the decimal number 2. Recall that a literal represents the actual typed value.\nCommon Numerical data Numbers, and thus numerical literals, are used everywhere in computer programs. This goes beyond obvious arithmetic and accounting applications. Modern graphics, artificial intelligence and simulation programs use numerical representations of data to quickly perform their operations. Thus, it is unsurprising that there are many ways to write and store numeric data.\nIntegers The first type of data we’ll deal with in our computer program is whole numbers. These are numbers such as 1, 0, -1, 25, -186, 12852, and more. In both mathematics and programming, we refer to these numbers as integers. An integer is any whole number, or a real number without a fraction or decimal component. We sometimes refer to these numbers as counting numbers.\nTo store these numbers in our computer program, we typically use a signed integer data type. This data type allows us to store both positive and negative numbers in binary in our computer’s memory. We won’t go too far into the details of how that works in this course, but there is more information on how that works on Wikipedia\nFloating Point Next, we’ll also need to handle numbers that include a fraction or decimal component. These include rational numbers such as 1.5, -2.98, 3 1/3, and even irrational numbers such as $ e $ and $ \\pi $.\nOur computer uses a special representation known as floating point to store these numbers. Floating point is very similar to scientific notation, where a number such as 1,230,000 is represented as $ 1.23 * 10^{6} $. In this example, 1.23 is the significand and 6 is the exponent of the number. It is known as floating point because the decimal point “floats around” the number based on the exponent. We could represent the same number as $ 12.3 * 10^{5} $ or $ 0.123 * 10^{7} $ just by adjusting the exponent, causing the decimal point to move within the significand.\nModern computers use the IEEE 754 standard for encoding floating-point numbers into binary. Again, we won’t go into the specifics here, but the graphic below gives us a good idea of how a floating point number can be broken up and stored in binary.\n1\nHere we can see that a 64 bit space in memory is divided into three parts, one for the sign (to denote either a positive or negative number), another for the exponent, and a third for the fraction or significand of the number.\nFloating Points are Approximations Just like there are rational numbers (such as 1/3) which cannot be exactly represented in the base 10 decimal number system, there are numbers which cannot be exactly exactly represented in base 2 (the underlying binary system used by you computer). In fact, there are many more rational numbers that cannot be exactly represented by binary numbers (hence floats) than there are in a base 10 system.\nIn addition to this, because floats have a finite (set) number of bits, there is a limit to the number of significant bits you can count on (typically 16 for a 64-bit float). This is generally only a concern in scientific computing (where you deal with either very big or very small numbers). However, many programs use common graphic processing units, which use only 32-bits (7 significant digits) to speed up calculations. This much lower accuracy can cause problems with statistical simulations.\nBoolean Boolean values, named for George Boole represent true and false in a computer program. While it may be as simple as storing a single bit, with 0 and 1 representing true and false, most programming languages provide a special way to deal with these values as they are very important in our computer programs. We’ll spend most of the next several chapters discussing how to work with Boolean values, but for now they are just another type of data our program could store.\nText as Data Character Many high-level programming languages have a character data type. A character represents a single letter in a written language such as English. Most programming languages use a special code called ASCII, or the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It defines a numerical value for each character in the English language, as well as several special characters such as the newline or \\n character we’ve already seen. Below is a table showing the entire ASCII code.\n2\nSo, to store the character c, our computer would store the number 99 in binary. We should also notice that the capital and lowercase letters are separate, so C is 67.\nModern computer programming languages also support the use of Unicode characters. We won’t cover that in this course, but it is important to remember later on when working with languages other than English.\nString Sometimes we want to store entire sentences in our computer programs. A sentence is just a String of characters, object-oriented languages use a string class for this purpose and we’ll cover everything we need to know about strings in a later chapter.\nFile:IEEE 754 Double Floating Point Format.svg.

On the far left is the file tree, which shows all of the files accessible to you for this tutorial. Then, in the middle, you may also see one or more open files as tabs at the top of that panel. Those files are usually the ones that you need to edit to complete the example on this page. You can freely open additional files if needed in that panel, or rearrange the panels as needed. However, whenever you enter this page, it will reset the view back to the default.\nIn the first programming module of the course, we’ll discuss more information about how to use Codio to run any code that you’ve created. For now, we’ll just use text files to introduce the interface.\nOnce you’ve completed the example, most pages will include a section at the bottom that allows you to check your work. Just like the other questions, these assessments will count toward your grade on the tutorial project. See if you can complete the exercise and pass the test below.

There are many different ways to do this using the Codio platform. We’ll discuss each of them in detail here.\nTerminal Codio includes a built-in Linux terminal, which allows us to perform actions directly on a command-line interface just like we would on an actual computer running Linux. We can access the Terminal in many ways:\nSelecting the Tools menu, then choosing the Terminal option Pressing SHIFT + ALT + T in any Codio window (you can customize this shortcut in your Codio user preferences) Pressing the Open Terminal icon in the file tree Additionally, some pages may already open a terminal window for us in the left-hand pane, as this page so helpfully does. As we can see, we’re never very far away from a terminal.\nNew to Linux? No worries! We’ll give you everything you need to know to compile and run your Java programs in this course.\nIf you’d like to learn a bit more about the Linux terminal and some of the basic commands, feel free to check out this great video on YouTube:\nYouTube Video\nNote: CC 210 requires no more Linux knowledge than CC 110.\nLet’s go to the terminal window and navigate to our program. When we first open the Terminal window, it should show us a prompt that looks somewhat like this one:\nThere is quite a bit of information there, but we’re interested in the last little bit of the last line, where it says ~/workspace. That is the current directory, or folder, our terminal is looking at, also known as our working directory. We can always find the full location of our working directory by typing the pwd command, short for “Print Working Directory,” in the terminal. Let’s try it now!\nEnter this command in the terminal:\npwd and we should see output similar to this:\nIn that output, we’ll see that the full path to our working directory is /home/codio/workspace. This is the default location for all of our content in Codio, and its where everything shown in the file tree to the far left is stored. When working in Codio, we’ll always want to store our work in this directory.\nNext, let’s use the ls command, short for “LiSt,” to see a list of all of the items in that directory:\n~/workspace$ ls java README.md We should see a short list of items appear in the terminal.\nWe can use the cd command, short for “Change Directory,” to change the working directory. To change to the java directory, type cd into the terminal window, followed by the name of that directory:\n~/workspace$ cd java ~/workspace/java$ We are now in the java directory, as we can see by observing the ~/workspace/java on the current line in the terminal. Finally, we can do the ls command again to see the files in that directory:\n~/workspace/java$ ls HelloWorld.java We should see our HelloWorld.java file! If it doesn’t appear, try using this command to get to the correct directory: cd /home/codio/workspace/java.\nOnce we’re at the point where we can see the HelloWorld.java file, we can move on to actually compiling and running the program.\nCompiling in Terminal To compile a Java program in the terminal, we’ll use the javac command, short for Java Compiler, followed by the name of the Java file we’d like to compile. So, in our case, we’ll do the following:\njavac HelloWorld.java If it works correctly, we shouldn’t get any additional output. The compiler will look through our Java file and create a new file containing the Java bytecode for our program, called HelloWorld.class. We can use the ls command to see it:\nls Problems? If the javac command gives you any output, or doesn’t create a HelloWorld.class file, that most likely means that your code has an error in it. Go back to the previous page and double-check that the contents of HelloWorld.java exactly match what is shown at the bottom of the page. You can also read the error message output by javac to determine what might be going wrong in your file.\nWe’ll cover information about simple debugging steps on the next page as well. If you get stuck, now is a great time request help via your course’s help system. You aren’t in this alone!\nRunning in Terminal Finally, we can now run our program! Once it is compiled, just type the following in the terminal to run it:\njava HelloWorld That’s all there is to it! We’ve now successfully compiled and run our first Java program. Of course, we can run the program as many times as we want by repeating the previous java command. If we make changes to the HelloWorld.java file, we’ll need to recompile it using the previous javac command first. Then, if those changes instruct the computer to do something different, we should see those changes when we run the program after compiling it.\nTry It! See if you can change the HelloWorld.java file to print out a different message. Once you’ve changed it, use the javac and java commands to compile and run the updated program. Make sure you see the correct output!\nCodio Assessments Last, but not least, many of the Codio tutorials and projects in this program will include assessments that we must solve by writing code. Codio can then automatically run the program and check for specific things, such as the correct output, in order to give us a grade. For most of these questions, we’ll be able to make changes to our code as many times as we’d like to get the correct answer.

    "content": "Beyond numbers, there are a few other primitive data types in Java. Let’s take a quick look at them and see how they can be used in our programs.\nBoolean Java supports a primitive data type named boolean that can only store two values: true and false. As we might expect, we can use these boolean variables to store answers to questions in our program, such as “Is x greater than y?” At this point, we won’t use boolean variables for much in our programs, but in a later module we’ll cover the basics of boolean logic and learn how to use these variables to control how our program runs.\nCharacter Java also has a char data type, which can be used to store a single character of text. It uses the 16-bit Unicode format to store the data, which is the same as ASCII for simple characters and commands.\nDeclaring \u0026 Assigning To declare a variable using these data types, the format is the same as the numerical data types:\nboolean t; char c; We can also assign values to each variable. For example, to assign a value to a boolean variable, we could do this:\nboolean t; t = true; boolean f = false; Notice that both true and false are keywords in Java, which means that we won’t have to put them in quotation marks to use them. These values can be used to directly represent the boolean values True and False, respectively. Some programming languages, most notably C, do not support boolean values in this way, but Java includes them as keywords.\nFor characters, the process is similar:\nchar c; c = 'a'; char d = 'B'; Notice that we use a single quotation mark ' around character values in our code. This is very important to remember! In our Hello World example, we used double quotation marks \" around strings, or sentences of text. For a single character, however, we only use a single quotation mark.\nCharacters \u0026 Strings Thankfully, the Java compiler will catch this problem pretty quickly. For example, take a look at this code, and see if you can spot the errors:\nchar c = \"a\"; System.out.println(\"c\"); When we first try to compile the program, we should get the following error:\nAs we can see, the compiler will not allow us to assign the string \"a\" to the variable c, which is of type char. So, to fix this error, we’ll need to modify our code to be the following:\nchar c = 'a'; System.out.println(\"c\"); However, there might be another error in this code. Can you spot it? What will be printed to the screen when we run this program?\nLet’s find out:\nYou might have expected the program to output a, but instead it output c. This is because we have \"c\" inside of our System.out.println method. To print the value stored inside a variable, we shouldn’t put it in quotation marks. Otherwise, it will interpret that as a string, and print the name of the variable (or whatever is in quotation marks) instead.\n",

To create a complex number, use the following syntax:\n\u003cidentifier\u003e = \u003creal\u003e+\u003cimaginary\u003ej So, to represent the complex number $ 1 + 2i $, we would create a variable using this code:\nx = 1+2j print(type(x)) This program would tell us that x is of type complex. We won’t use complex numbers in this course, but it may be useful to know that they are available in Python.\nBoolean Python supports a primitive data type named bool that can only store two values: True and False.

    "content": "\nRequirements Analysis Software Development is more than just programming. It is a disciplined process of converting requirement into finished product. It consists of five phases, the first of which is requirements analysis. In requirements analysis you try and describe the problem you are trying to solve and the features you want the solution to have. Throughout CC 210, the exercise or project statement serves as the requirements analysis phase.\nDesign Next comes the design phase. In design we describe the solution. In Object-oriented programming this generally consist of designing the classes and the interactions between them which meet the requirements.\nA class is a collection of data and the methods (procedures) by which data is accessed and manipulated. Classes are generally organized around things (the shopping cart from any online store is a classic example) or functions (communication with your computer’s WIFI card is probably handled by a class). The design of many of CC 210 exercises and projects will be provided to you.\nCoding (Development) Following design is the coding phase, where programs are written to build the design. This is the emphasis area of CC 210. Students will code classes, or fragments of classes–with their associated variables and methods; and test these methods as you write them.\nLow level testing is organic to the coding process. Imagine you were writing the Goldilocks Porridge Temperature Tester, which takes as input a temperature and outputs “too hot”, “too cold” or “just right”. Better programmers would test their code with a value from each range to make certain the output is correct. When a program fails a test, it is said to have a “bug” and the process of finding and fixing bugs is called debugging.\nThe advantages of testing as you code are\nthat you develop the test cases and therefore have a good understanding of what the code is supposed to accomplish and where the problems might be. Any bugs must have been introduced or revealed by the last bit of code you wrote. So, if you follow a “code-a-little-test-a-little” approach, you can quickly narrow down the parts of the code which contain the error. If you write too much code before testing any of it, it can be hard to isolate the bugs.\nFormal Test When the coders believe they have a properly working product, the development enters the formal test phase. Generally, a separate set of developers put the software through its paces and report any bugs they find. Some of these bugs will be fixed and retested, while others may be left in the code to be addressed at a future date. When you run the autograder you have effectively entered the formal test phase.\nDeployment Finally, there is the deployment phase. This were people and systems start using your code. The analogous activity for CC 210 certifying your module is complete.\n",

    "content": " YouTube Video Resources Slides Code.org Quotes Video Script Finally, before embarking on this program, let’s take a brief minute to review what you’ll learn by the time you complete the program.\nOf course, the biggest and most impactful outcome will be learning how to write computer programs. Throughout the Computational Core program, you’ll learn either the Java or Python programming language, and get to a point where you are quite proficient with your language of choice. You’ll be capable of building your own programs from scratch to meet many of the challenges you’ll encounter in your career or elsewhere. This skill alone will set you well above your peers.\nThere are many additional benefits beyond just learning how to write programs. For starters, programming involves a large amount of problem solving and computational thinking, and these courses will help sharpen you skills in both areas. In addition to programming, you’ll also learn about software engineering methods that will help you build better programs, but also data structures and algorithms that will make your code more efficient and useful as it manipulates and stores data. Of course, you’ll also pick up some new math and logic skills, as both are vitally important to understanding computer code. Lastly, we’ll spend a bit of time discussing how computers actually work, so you can see how your code actually gets a computer to perform the tasks you desire.\nFinally, you may be asking yourself why this is important. I could absolutely bring out large numbers of statistics stating how many computer programming jobs are available right now, and how we have a distinct lack of capable graduates to fill these positions. I could also talk about how much more money you could make as a computer programmer than in many other fields. But, instead, I think it is best to just present this quote from Stephen Hawking, one of the most brilliant people to ever live:\nWhether you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you just want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn. - Stephen Hawking\nThis is just one of the many great quotes encouraging you to learn computer programming from Code.org. I highly recommend checking out their quote archive whenever you need additional inspiration.\nThat should cover all of the background information you’ll need before you start this program. The rest of this module includes the full course syllabus and a few assignments that you should read through before beginning the course, but you don’t have to do anything else for them right now. Finally, this module wraps up with a quick quiz making sure you are 100% ready to take this course.\nBest of luck to you on your adventure through this program!\n",

    "content": "Now that you’ve seen a few pages in Codio, let’s take a minute to discuss some of the features of the Codio user interface. Of course, Codio has some amazing documentation, so feel free to check that out as you work with Codio.\nFirst, let’s look at the menu items at the top of the page. There are several available to you that are worth mentioning. For starters, you can click the Codio Icon at any time to go directly to your Codio dashboard.\nUnder the Codio menu, you can also find options to manage your preferences. Here you can adjust things such as the editor settings and theme. Feel free to adjust the settings to match your personal preferences.\nThe Project menu allows you to work with the currently loaded Codio project. Generally you won’t need to access many of these items unless your project stops working. However, they are provided for your use in case you need them.\nThe File menu contains options for manipulating the file tree, such as creating new files, renaming them, saving them, and even downloading and uploading files. As you work on larger projects, you’ll be using many of these options to manage the files within your project.\nNext, the Edit menu gives you access to the Undo and Redo action.\nThe Find menu contains entries for searching documents and performing a find-and-replace operation. Most of those actions should be pretty self-explanatory.\nThe View menu allows you to customize your view in Codio. Here we’ll find options for managing panels, open tabs, editor settings, and more. Feel free to make use of these options to arrange your Codio view as you prefer. Also, at the bottom of this menu is a Play Guide option, which is very helpful if you accidentally close the guide and need to reopen it.\nUnder the Tools menu, you’ll find an option for accessing the Terminal in your project. The Terminal gives you console access to the box that your project is running on.As you work through the content in this program, we’ll slowly introduce the Terminal and some of the tasks it can perform.\nThe Education menu is very important, though it only has a single entry. The Mark as Completed option allows you to indicate that you have completed this Codio project or tutorial. Once you select that option, your work will automatically be graded and your grade will be sent to Canvas. From there, you can access the next project or module in the course.\n||| warning\nDon’t Submit Projects Accidentally! Be very careful when completing a project! Once you’ve marked a project as completed, it will become read-only, and you won’t be able to make any additional changes to the project. So, you’ll need to make sure you’ve finished everything in the project first. If you accidentally mark a project as completed, you may contact the instructors for help. Depending on the situation, they may be able to unlock it for you so you can continue your work. However, unlocking a completed project is entirely at the discretion of the instructor.\n|||\nFinally, the Help menu gives you access to many of the support features in Codio. If you get stuck, you may want to review some of the help options available here. Of course, you can always post a message in the course help forum or email for assistance! This is for help with Codio, not for help on the lesson content. In general your first request for help should be through the CC210-Help email.\nThere are also a few other items in the interface you should be aware of. First, in the File Tree, there is a Play icon that can also be used to open the guide for the current project.\nIn the guide, there are a couple of options available by clicking the gear icon in the upper-right of the page. First, there is an option to Restore Current Files. This option will restore the contents of any currently open files back to the default contents from when you first opened the project. In addition, this menu also contains another way to mark the current project as completed.\nThat covers most of the major features of the Codio interface that we’ll be using in this course. If you have any questions about how to use Codio, feel free to ask your teahers or email for assistance.\n",

    "content": "A variable in a high level language is just a memory address. It tells the compiler/interpreter where to start looking for the binary string of data.\nDecoding the binary All high-level programming languages use a type system to tell the system how to decode the binary data it finds there. All types have a size and a semantic, how many bits to grab and how to interpret each bit. Consider the 2-byte (16-bit) binary sequence 1100 0110 1110 0100, it can be interpreted as many values based on its type.\nTYPE value 16-bit floating point -6.891 16-bit unsigned integer 50916 16-bit 2’s complement integer -14620 8-bit ASCII Æ ä Performing Operations Operations and methods are only defined for specific types: you can divide two integers, but not two characters; integer division works differently than floating point division (more on this later in this chapter). It is up to the programmer to select the appropriate type for a variable and keep track of it.\nImplications for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) All objects are created from a class definition. An object made from the class definition, class Cat ... would be a variable of type Cat. A key part of OOP is that objects modify their own data. So, understanding what types your variables are is vital to understanding program state, which allows you to verify correct behavior and troubleshoot buggy code.\nTyping Systems Explicit Static (i.e. Java) One typing system, often used by compiled languages, is the explicit static type system. In this scheme the programmer explicitly tells the compiler the type of each variable when the is declared or defined. The statement uint16 x = 5; tells the compiler that:\nit should reserve a memory address for a 16-bit variable (the size of unint16) that the programmer is going to use the alias ‘x’ for that memory address it should always interpret the 16-bits of ‘x’ as an unsigned integer it should put the binary string which, when evaluated as a uint16 is equal to the decimal number 5 into the reserved memory address Implicit Dynamic (i.e. Python) Another typing system, often used by interpreted languages, is the implicit dynamic system. In this system, the interpreter infers (guesses) the type of the variable based on the literal or variable in the definition. The statement x = 5 tells the interpreter:\nto infer a type based on the literal “5” to reserve a memory address for the inferred type that the programmer is going to use the alias ‘x’ for that memory address to put the binary string which, when evaluated as the inferred type is equal to the decimal number 5 into the reserved memory address Converting Between Types High-level languages typically have operations or methods to convert from one data type to another.\nFor example, in Java, to print a line to the terminal (the System.out object), one uses its println() method. This method takes as a parameter a literal or variable of type String.\nIf you have integer, and you want to print it to the terminal, you can use the Integer class’s tostring() method which takes as a parameter an int and provides (returns) the text equivalent.\n// Java 1 int x = 5; 2 String xString = Integer.toString(x); 3 System.out.println(xString); Here on line 1 we declare x to be variable of type int (an integer), and assign it the initial value of 5.\nLine 2 declares xString to be a variable of type String, and assigns it the String value of evaluating the method Integer.toString(x). This will be “5”. Line 3 prints out xString.\nSimilarly Python’s built in print() method also takes a parameter of type String.\n# Python 1 x = 5 2 x_String = str(x) 3 print(xString) Where types are implicitly determined and where built the in functions str() and print() serve the same purpose as toString() and println() in Java.\nWhen a programmer explicitly tells the computer to convert one variable Type to another, the process is called casting.\nHowever, both languages will accept their version of the following\nx \u003c- 5 DISPLAY (x) through a process call coercion.\nIn most modern high-level languages, when a method is supplied the wrong type of parameter the language checks to see if there is an automatic conversion from the supplied type to the required type. If so the language first converts the offending parameter, then calls the method. The same procedure is used for operators. Depending of coercion for simple types is a common practice. Depending on it for more complex types or programmer developed classes can be perilous.\nIn practice, prefer casting over coercion. Casting ensures the program does exactly what you want.\nPseudo Code for Variable Assignment The above code is an example of pseudo code. It is not an actual programming language, but rather an outlining language with an informal syntax. The focus is on what to do, not how to do it. A programmer might first write the pseudo code for a stretch of code, ensure it makes sense, then code it up in the proper implementation language. Together with flowcharting, pseudo code is one of the modeling techniques you might use to “mock up” your program during the code phase of the software development cycle.

    "content": " Of course, when developing a computer program, there are always times when things don’t quite work the way we’d like them to. Let’s review a few of the common errors and how to solve them.\nCompiler Issues The Java Compiler is usually the source of most of our woes when first learning how to write programs in Java. The compiler expects the source code to be correctly formatted, or else it won’t be able to generate the Java bytecode for our program. Let’s modify our HelloWorld.java file to include some errors, just to see exactly what the error messages from the compiler are like.\nMissing Braces First, let’s replace everything in HelloWorld.java with the following code:\npublic class HelloWorld{ public static void main(String[] args){ System.out.println(\"Hello World\"); } Spot the Error Before compiling that program, can you spot the error? Being able to find errors in code without using a compiler will definitely help you develop programs much faster. It is just like being able to spell words correctly without using a spell-checker. It makes everything go just a bit more smoothly.\nIn each of the examples in this section, take a minute and see if you can spot the error before running it through the compiler. The quiz in this module includes a few questions that require you to spot the error in a piece of code, so this is great practice for later!\nOnce we’ve updated that file, we can compile it using the using the terminal. When we do, we should see output similar to this:\nThat error message gives us quite a bit of information. The first part, java/HelloWorld.java tells us which file the error is in, which is handy later on when we start working in programs that include multiple source code files. Following that, we see a 7 after the file name, which tells us that the error is on or around line 7. However, that doesn’t always mean that we’ll need to edit something at line 7 to fix the error; it just means that the Java Compiler realized there was an error when it reached line 7. Sometimes, we must make a change elsewhere in the file to resolve the issue.\nAfter that, we’ll see the actual error message, which in this case is error: reached end of file while parsing. That may not seem very helpful at first, but it actually gives us an important clue.\nIf we look at the code above, we’ll notice that it is missing the second closing brace } at the end of the file. So, the compiler was expecting to see one more closing brace, but didn’t find it. So, to fix that, we’ll just need to add one more closing brace at the end of the file, and it should work just fine.\nMissing Semicolon Here’s another example we can try:\npublic class HelloWorld{ public static void main(String[] args){ System.out.println(\"Hello World\") } } When we try to compile this file, we should get output similar to the following:\nIn this example, the output is really helpful. It clearly shows us exactly where in our code we forgot to include a semicolon. By adding that symbol where indicated, we can solve the problem.\nRuntime Issues Of course, there are some problems that the compiler may not catch. These are known as runtime errors, since they happen at the time we run our programs. They can be especially tricky to deal with, but thankfully they are usually quite rare.\nIncorrect Main Method Let’s look at one more example:\npublic class HelloWorld{ public static void main(String args){ System.out.println(\"Hello World\"); } } This time, the program actually compiles! However, when we try to actually run the file, we’ll get an error similar to this one:\nThis is because we accidentally forgot the square brackets [] in the main method declaration. It should be public static void main(String[] args), as the error message so helpfully tells us. So, it is important to remember that our programs may still have errors, even if the compiler doesn’t find any.\nBreak Stuff Now that you’ve learned a bit about how to debug compiler errors, let’s see if you can figure out how to cause one! Modify HelloWorld.java in a way that causes the compiler to output the following error message:\nerror: class WrongClass is public, should be declared in a file named WrongClass.java\n",

Let’s review a few of the common errors and how to solve them.\nWrong Interpreter When working with Python, one of the most common mistakes is typing the python command when we actually mean to use the python3 command. This would cause our program to be interpreted with the Python 2 interpreter instead of the Python 3 interpreter. Those versions of Python are not fully compatible, so we might see some strange errors.\nFor example, if we write our HelloWorld.py file using syntax for Python 2, and try to run it using the Python 3 interpreter, we may see an error similar to this one:\nWe might run into similar problems if we ran code written for Python 3 in the Python 2 interpreter.\nSyntax Issues One of the easiest errors to run into when learning how to program is forgetting a syntax element. To see how that works, let’s replace the code in our HelloWorld.py file with the following:\nprint(\"Hello World\" Spot the Error Before running that program, can you spot the error? Being able to find errors in code without using an interpreter will definitely help you develop programs much faster. It is just like being able to spell words correctly without using a spell-checker. It makes everything go just a bit more smoothly.\nIn each of the examples in this section, take a minute and see if you can spot the error before running it through the interpreter. The quiz in this module includes a few questions that require you to spot the error in a piece of code, so this is great practice for later!\nOnce we’ve updated that file, we can run it using the method of our choice, either using the terminal or the options in the Run Menu. When we do, we should see output similar to this:\nThat error message gives us quite a bit of information. The first part, File \"1p-hello/HelloWorld.py\" tells us which file the error is in, which is handy later on when we start working in programs that include multiple source code files. Following that, we see a line 2 after the file name, which tells us that the error is on or around line 2. However, that doesn’t always mean that we’ll need to edit something at line 2 to fix the error; it just means that the Python Interpreter realized there was an error when it reached line 2. Sometimes, we must make a change elsewhere in the file to resolve the issue.\nAfter that, we’ll see the actual error message, which in this case is SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing. In this message, EOF refers to the end of the file. That may not seem very helpful at first, but it actually gives us an important clue.\nIf we look at the code above, we’ll notice that it is missing the closing parenthesis ) at the end of the line of code. So, the interpreter was expecting to see a closing parenthesis, but didn’t find it. So, to fix that, we’ll just need to add a closing parenthesis at the end of that line of code, and it should work just fine.\nWe would see a similar error if we left off an ending quotation mark \" as well.\nIncorrect Function Here’s another example we can try:\npint(\"Hello World\") When we try to run this file, we should get output similar to the following:\nIn this example, the output is really helpful. It clearly shows us exactly where in our code our error is, and we can see that the error is NameError: name 'pint' is not defined. If we look closely at the line indicated in the error message, we should see that we simply misspelled the name of the print() method, which can easily be corrected.\nBreak Stuff Now that you’ve learned a bit about how to debug interpreter errors, let’s see if you can figure out how to cause one! Modify HelloWorld.py in a way that causes the interpreter to output the following error message:\nSyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'\n",

    "content": "We have chosen to approach the computational core from the object-oriented perspective. Java and Python both support it. However, it is easier to understand objects (and classes, the name for the code that implements them) after going over a few more fundamental concepts. Thus, in the first few modules you will be asked to copy some code verbatim, with little explanation. Alternatively, you may be asked to only write code between certain comment bars, where we have provided the “header” and “footer” code necessary to make the program.\nBefore we begin programming, let’s go over some basic terminology and rules for high-level programming languages.\nSyntax First all high programming languages have a syntax, a pattern of words and symbols that correct instructions follow. When you receive a syntax error, it means the structure of one or more of your instructions does not follow the language’s rules. In a very real sense, this is the grammar that all correct programming lines will follow.\nNatural languages also have a grammar, but most natural language listeners can understand improper grammar. The question “Which room is the dog in”, containing the dreaded dangling preposition, will almost certainly be correctly interpreted as “In which room is the dog”.\nProgramming languages are not like this – the slightest violation of a grammar rule will result in code that most likely will not run.\nSemantic Second, all programming instructions have a meaning, called a semantic. When your program runs but does not do what you thought it would do, this is a semantic error. Often a semantic error, a bug, occurs when the coder imperfectly understands the effect of the instruction.\nInitial Vocabulary Finally, all programming languages have “parts of speech”, by which the languages identify what kind of thing a word (number) is. Common “parts of speech” include:\nkeywords - a word that has a special meaning. These words tell the program exactly what to do, and we cannot use these words as identifiers. For example, in both Java and Python the word “class” is a keyword; you cannot use a keyword for any purpose other than the one(s) intended by the programming language. literal – text evaluated as itself, for example numbers (i.e. 6.626) are meant to represent themselves. Similarly, text literals are most often enclosed in double quotation marks (“wildcat”). Text literals are most commonly referred to as strings. identifiers - any class, method, or variable name is considered an identifier. Each language will have both rules (syntax) about what can be identifiers and conventions (style guides) about how to construct them. variable – a programmer-defined piece of data. Programmers name their variables with an identifier. method - a piece of code that performs an action in our program. Methods are sometimes referred to as functions or subroutines as well, but we’ll use the term method. Programmers name their methods with an identifier. class – a collection of variables and the methods used to manipulate that data. Classes lay at the heart of object-oriented programming and will be the focus of the last third of this course. symbols - any non-alphanumeric symbol which has special meaning. Common ones include the math symbols (+ - / * =), brackets of all forms (() [] {}) and the some not so obvious ones ( . , ; \" !). Subroutine, Function, and Method Properly, a subroutine is a generic term for a named code fragment that does something. Your programming language may have a subroutine named math.sqrt(x) that calculates the square root of ‘x’ or one called print (something) that prints what ever the value of ‘something’ is to the screen. The print() subroutine may be many lines long, but you gain access to it by calling (using) its name.\nThe issue is different programming languages use different words to refer to different kinds of subroutines. Functions in C may mean a different thing than functions in Fortran, Java, Python or mathematics.\nWe are not going to worry about the details, and will use method or occasionally function for callable subroutines.\n",

    "content": "Now that we’ve learned how to create our own variables, we can use them to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations. For most of these, we’ll use the same operator symbols that we’ve used before in math, but a few of them are unique to programming languages like Java.\nFor each of the examples below, we’ll assume that we have already created two int variables, x and y, as follows:\nint x = 5; int y = 8; Addition + Using the plus + symbol, we can add two numbers together and find their sum:\nint z = x + y; System.out.println(z); // 13 Since $ 5 + 8 = 13 $, this program would output 13.\nWhen writing our code, it is always good practice to put spaces between operators and operands unless otherwise noted, just to make it easier to read our code.\nThe plus symbol can also be use to concatenate or link multiple strings together. We’ll learn how to do that in the project for this chapter.\nCode Comments We can add comments to our code to help us describe it to others or simply understand it better ourselves. These comments are simply text that is added to the source code, but they are marked in a way that tells the compiler to ignore it when compiling the program.\nIn Java, we can use two forward slashes // to tell the compiler that everything on that line following those symbols should be treated as a comment, as we can see in the examples on this page.\nWe can also use a forward slash followed by an asterisk /* to start a multiline comment in Java. The compiler will ignore everything after that symbol until a closing asterisk followed by a forward slash */ is found.\nFinally, Java also uses a forward slash followed by two asterisk /** to denote special comments that can be used to automatically generate documentation for the code. Again, this comment section is closed by an asterisk followed by a forward slash */.\nTraditionally, each additional line in these multiline comments will be prefixed by an asterisk to make them easier to read. In fact, the Codio editor will do that for us!\nHere are some examples in code showing how those comments can be used.\n/** * This is a comment at the beginning of a class that gives * information about the class contained in this file * * @author Username * @version 1.0 */ public class Example{ /** * This is a comment at the beginning of a method. * It can give information about the inputs and outputs * of that method * * @param args - the command-line arguments */ public static void main(String[] args){ /* * This is a simple multi-line comment * It can have multiple lines * and ends with the slash below */ int x = 0; //This is a single line comment int y = 0; //Comment after code on the same line } } Feel free to use comments anywhere in your source code to help you understand what the code does! It is always better to include too many comments than too few, especially in larger programs.\nSubtraction - Likewise, we can use the minus - symbol to subtract two values and find their difference:\nint z = x - y; System.out.println(z); // -3 This program would output -3, since $ 5 - 8 = -3 $. It is important to remember that these operations can result in negative numbers, so the order of operands we use matters when subtracting.\nWe can also use the minus symbol to find the additive inverse of a number, or change the sign of a variable from positive to negative and vice-versa:\nint z = -x - y; System.out.println(-z); // 13 In this example, we use -x to denote the inverse of x. In this case, we don’t include a space between the minus symbol and the variable it is attached to. So, this expression will calculate $ -5 - 8 = -13 $ and store that value in z. Then, when we print that variable, we invert it again, so it will actually print 13 to the screen instead of the value $ -13 $ stored in z.\nMultiplication * We can also use the asterisk * or star symbol for multiplication to find the product of two numbers:\nint z = x * y; System.out.println(z); // 40 We know that $ 5 * 8 = 40 $, so this program would output 40 as expected.\nDivision / Division is a bit different. Most programming languages use the forward slash / symbol for division, making the statement look like a fraction. That is probably the easiest way to think about division in a programming language - it makes a fraction of the dividend and the divisor.\nEarlier in this chapter we discussed that strange things may happen when we try to divide two whole numbers. Let’s look at a few examples:\nint z = x / y; System.out.println(z); // 0 This first example will calculate $ 5 / 8 $ but store it in an int variable. We expect the answer to be $ 0.625 $, but since an int variable can only store a whole number, the result is truncated by removing the decimal portion. So, our program just outputs 0.\nHere’s another example:\nint z = -x / y; System.out.println(z); // 0 We know that $ -5 / 8 = -0.625 $, but once again the result is truncated and the decimal part is removed. So, this program will also output 0.\nLet’s look at another division example:\ndouble z = x / y; System.out.println(z); // 0.0 Here we are storing the result in a double variable. We’d expect the output to be 0.625, but we actually just get 0.0 when we run this program. That’s strange, isn’t it?\nEarlier we discussed some of the rules for how a programming language calculates numbers. One of those rules states that an operation performed on two whole numbers will result in a whole number, which is exactly what is happening here. The processor calculates $ 5 / 8 = 0 $ as a whole number using truncated division, then converts the value $ 0 $ to a floating point value before storing it in z. So, even though it appears we should be storing $ 0.625 $, we aren’t able to due to the data types of our two operands. This is a very common mistake made by programmers of all skill levels, so it is very important to understand what is going on.\nSo, how can we solve this issue? The answer lies in the use of a cast operation to convert the data type of one of our operators to a floating point value. Here’s an example showing how to accomplish that:\ndouble z = (double) x / y; System.out.println(z); // 0.625 In this example, we are casting the value stored in x to be of type double. Then, the division operation is performed, this time between a floating point number and a whole number, which will result in a floating point number. Finally, that result will be stored in z, and the program will output 0.625, which is the correct answer.\nIn short, we need to make sure we pay special attention when dividing numbers in our programs, just to make sure we are getting the result we expect.\nModulo % The modulo operator uses the percent sign % to calculate the remainder of a division operation. Let’s look at an example:\nint z = x % y; System.out.println(z); // 5 Here, we are calculating the remainder of the division $ 5 / 8 $. Since $ 8 $ does not go into $ 5 $ at all, we are left with $ 5 $ as the remainder of that division.\nIf we reverse the operands, we can get a different result:\nint z = y % x; System.out.println(z); // 3 Here, we are calculating the remainder of $ 8 / 5 $. Since $ 5 $ will go into $ 8 $ once, we can perform $ 8 - 5 = 3 $ to find the remainder of that division.\nModulo \u0026 Negative Numbers In Java, the modulo operation is treated like a true remainder operation. So, when applied to negative numbers, it will perform the expected division and return the remainder, which may be a negative number, depending on the signs of the operands. It follows the same sign rule as multiplication and division.\nHere are some examples:\nSystem.out.println(-8 % 5); // -3 System.out.println(-8 % -5); // -3 System.out.println(8 % -5); // 3 We already know that $ 8 % 5 = 3 $. In this case, the negative sign is applied if just one operand is negative. Otherwise, the result is positive if both operands are negative.\nIncrement ++ \u0026 Decrement -- Increment ++ and decrement -- are two special operators in Java. They are used to add or subtract $ 1 $ from an existing variable. Let’s look at a couple of examples:\nint z = x++; System.out.println(x); // 6 System.out.println(z); // 5 Here, the increment operator will increase the value stored in x by $ 1 $. In this case, we don’t include a space between the operator and the variable it is attached to. However, since the operator is after the variable, it will happen at the end of the operation. So, the value $ 5 $ will be stored in z first, then x will be incremented by $ 1 $ afterwards. So, the program will output 6 as the value of x, and 5 as the value of z.\nBy placing the increment operator in front of the variable, we can see a different outcome:\nint z = ++x; System.out.println(x); // 6 System.out.println(z); // 6 As we’d expect, here the increment operation will be performed first, and then the new value stored in x will also be stored in z, so both variables will contain the value $ 6 $ in this program.\nThe decrement operator works similarly, subtracting $ 1 $ instead of adding $ 1 $.\nIn practice, these operators are only used in a few scenarios, most notably within loops to increment or decrement a counter variable. In general, they can make our code more complex and difficult to read due to the variety of different ways these operators can be used.\nAssignment Shortcuts Finally, many operators in Java also have combined operation and assignment operators. These will perform the operation specified and store the value in the first variable, all in a single statement.\nOperator Example Equivalent += x += y; x = x + y; -= x -= y; x = x - y; *= x *= y; x = x * y; /= x /= y; x = x / y; %= x %= y; x = x % y; As with the increment and decrement operators, some of these shortcuts are rarely used in practice since they can make our code more difficult to read and understand. However, in some scenarios they can be quite helpful.\nOrder of Operations YouTube Video\nVideo Materials\nWe are already familiar with the order of operations in mathematics, using mnemonics such as “PEMDAS” to refer to the following order:\nParentheses Exponents Multiplication \u0026 Division Addition \u0026 Subtraction Programing languages work very similarly, but there are many more operators to deal with. Here’s a quick list of the order of operations, or operator precedence of the operators we’ve covered so far:\nParentheses Postfix: Increment ++ \u0026 Decrement -- after variable* Prefix: Inverse -, Increment ++ \u0026 Decrement -- before variable* Multiplicative: Multiplication *, Division /, and Modulo % Additive: Addition +, Subtraction - Assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= * The increment and decrement operations will be calculated either before or after the rest of the operation is performed, depending on where they are placed in relation to the associated variable. This lists what order they will be analyzed by the compiler to determine which variable they are attached to.\nHere’s a quick example to show how this works:\nint x = 1; int y = ++x + x - x / x * x % x--; System.out.println(x); System.out.println(y); Can we determine what the output should be? Let’s try to break it down!\nBased on the operator precedence table above, we know that the x-- will be evaluated first. However, since it is after the variable, it won’t be calculated until after the rest of the operation is complete. So, we can just remember that step for now, and we’ll actually perform that calculation last.\nNext, we know that ++x will be evaluated. This step must be performed before any other operation since it is before the variable, so we must immediately increment the value of x by $ 1 $. So, x is now $ 2 $.\nNow we can perform all of the multiplicative operations, going from left to right. So, by adding the appropriate parentheses, we’d calculate the following:\n$$ x + x - x / x * x \\% x $$ $$ 2 + 2 - 2 / 2 * 2 \\% 2 $$ $$ 2 + 2 - (2 / 2) * 2 \\% 2 $$ $$ 2 + 2 - ((2 / 2 * 2) \\% 2 $$ $$ 2 + 2 - (((2 / 2) * 2) \\% 2) $$ $$ 2 + 2 - ((1 * 2) \\% 2) $$ $$ 2 + 2 - (2 \\% 2) $$ $$ 2 + 2 - 0 $$\nFollowing that, we can perform any additive operations. Once again, we can add parentheses as appropriate to find the following:\n$$ 2 + 2 - 0 $$ $$ (2 + 2) - 0 $$ $$ ((2 + 2) - 0) $$ $$ (4 - 0) $$ $$ 4 $$\nOnce we’ve calculated all of the operations on the right-hand side of the assignment operator, we can then perform the assignment operation to store the final value $ 4 $ in y.\nFinally, we must remember to go back and decrement the value in x by $ 1 $, so x once again is just $ 1 $.\nSo, the final output from this program would be:\nHowever, as any good math teacher will tell us, it is always better to use additional parentheses to make sure our operations are performed in the correct order instead of relying on the order of operations. So, we should definitely avoid writing code as ambiguous as the example given above.\nWeb Only This content is presented in the course directly through Codio.

We’ll learn how to do that in the project for this chapter.\nCode Comments We can add comments to our code to help us describe it to others or simply understand it better ourselves. These comments are simply text that is added to the source code, but they are marked in a way that tells the compiler to ignore it when compiling the program.\nIn Python, we can use the number sign or hash symbol # to tell the compiler that everything on that line following those symbols should be treated as a comment, as we can see in the examples on this page.\nWe can also use three quotation marks \"\"\" before and after a block to text to create a multiline comment. However, these are not precisely the same as comments, since the interpreter treats the block as a value that is not assigned to any variable.\nThat said, Python uses these mutliline comments to create docstrings that describe the actions of a file or method. We’ll learn more about creating those docstrings later in this course.\nHere are some examples in code showing how those comments can be used.\n\"\"\" This is a docstring comment at the beginning of a file that gives information about the code contained in this file \"\"\" # This is a single line comment x = 0 y = 5 # Comments can even go after a line of code Feel free to use comments anywhere in your source code to help you understand what the code does! It is always better to include too many comments than too few, especially in larger programs.\nSubtraction - Likewise, we can use the minus - symbol to subtract two values and find their difference:\nz = x - y print(z) # -3 This program would output -3, since $ 5 - 8 = -3 $. It is important to remember that these operations can result in negative numbers, so the order of operands we use matters when subtracting.\nWe can also use the minus symbol to find the additive inverse of a number, or change the sign of a variable from positive to negative and vice-versa:\nz = -x - y print(-z) # 13 In this example, we use -x to denote the inverse of x. In this case, we don’t include a space between the minus symbol and the variable it is attached to. So, this expression will calculate $ -5 - 8 = -13 $ and store that value in z. Then, when we print that variable, we invert it again, so it will actually print 13 to the screen instead of the value $ -13 $ stored in z.\nMultiplication * We can also use the asterisk * or star symbol for multiplication to find the product of two numbers:\nz = x * y print(z) # 40 We know that $ 5 * 8 = 40 $, so this program would output 40 as expected.\nExponent ** Python also includes a special operator to perform the exponentiation, or power, operation. It is a set of two asterisks ** or stars. We can use it as follows:\nz = x ** y #alternate z = pow(x,y) print(z) # 390625 While it may take some work, we can verify the result of $ 5^{8} = 390625 $ is correct.\nDivision / Division is a bit different. Most programming languages use the forward slash / symbol for division, making the statement look like a fraction. That is probably the easiest way to think about division in a programming language - it makes a fraction of the dividend and the divisor.\nEarlier in this chapter we discussed that strange things may happen when we try to divide two whole numbers. Let’s look at a few examples:\nz = x / y print(z) # 0.625 This first example will calculate $ 5 / 8 $ but store it in an float variable. So, even though both x and y are of type int, the result will always be of type float.\nOf course, we can always convert the result to an int using the built-in int() method, as shown in this example:\nz = int(x / y) print(z) # 0 This will output 0, since z is now of type int. Remember that the int() function will truncate the decimal portion of the result.\nIn short, we need to make sure we pay special attention when dividing numbers in our programs, just to make sure we are getting the result we expect.\nFloor Division // Python also includes another special operator for floor division, which is two forward slashes //. This operator will round the result of a division down to the next smallest whole number. Let’s look at a couple of examples:\nz = x // y print(z) # 0 This first example will output 0, since the result of $ 5 / 8 = 0.625 $ will be floored down to $ 0 $.\nHowever, this example shows what is unique about this operation:\nz = -x // y print(z) # -1 We can calculate the result of $ -5 / 8 = -0.625 $, just as we’d expect. However, since the floor operation will round down toward negative infinity, the output here is -1, which is the next smallest integer. It can be a bit confusing at first, but hopefully it makes sense.\nModulo % The modulo operator uses the percent sign % to calculate the remainder of a division operation. Let’s look at an example:\nint z = x % y print(z) # 5 Here, we are calculating the remainder of the division $ 5 / 8 $. Since $ 8 $ does not go into $ 5 $ at all, we are left with $ 5 $ as the remainder of that division.\nIf we reverse the operands, we can get a different result:\nint z = y % x print(z) # 3 Here, we are calculating the remainder of $ 8 / 5 $. Since $ 5 $ will go into $ 8 $ once, we can perform $ 8 - 5 = 3 $ to find the remainder of that division.\nModulo \u0026 Negative Numbers In Python, the modulo operation is performed as a floor division remainder. So, if the division operation is $ a // b = q $ with remainder $ r $, the remainder must satisfy the equation $ b * q + r = a $. Therefore, the result may be different depending on the signs of the operands.\nHere are some examples:\nprint(int(-8 % 5)) # 2 print(int(8 % -5)) # -2 print(int(-8 % -5)) # -3 In the first example, we would perform $ -8 // 5 = -2 $, since $ -2 $ is the next smallest whole number. Then, to find the remainder, we must satisfy the equation $ 5 * -2 + r = -8 $. So, to solve that equation, we would find that $ x = 2 $.\nIn the second example, we’d perform a similar division first, which is $ 8 // -5 = -2 $. However, when we fill in the equation, we would get $ -5 * -2 + r = 8 $, which would yield $ x = -2 $.\nFinally, the third example would find the result of the division $ -8 // -5 = 1 $. Then, we can use the second equation to find $ -5 * 1 + r = -8 $, where $ r = -3 $ in that case.\nIn short, the value itself may change depending on the signs of the operands, so you must be careful when using the modulo operation on negative numbers.\nAssignment Shortcuts Finally, many operators in Python also have combined operation and assignment operators. These will perform the operation specified and store the value in the first variable, all in a single statement.\nOperator Example Equivalent += x += y x = x + y -= x -= y x = x - y *= x *= y x = x * y **= x **= y x = x ** y /= x /= y x = x / y //= x //= y x = x // y %= x %= y x = x % y Some of these shortcuts are rarely used in practice since they can make our code more difficult to read and understand. However, in some scenarios they can be quite helpful.\nOrder of Operations YouTube Video\nVideo Materials\nWe are already familiar with the order of operations in mathematics, using mnemonics such as “PEMDAS” to refer to the following order:\nParentheses Exponents Multiplication \u0026 Division Addition \u0026 Subtraction Programing languages work very similarly, but there are many more operators to deal with. Here’s a quick list of the order of operations, or operator precedence of the operators we’ve covered so far:\nParentheses Exponentiation: ** Prefix: Inverse - Multiplicative: Multiplication *, Division /, Floor Division //, and Modulo % Additive: Addition +, Subtraction - Assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, **=, /=, //=, %= Here’s a quick example to show how this works:\nx = 2 x += -x + x - x / x * x ** x % x // x print(x) Can we determine what the output should be? Let’s try to break it down!\nBased on the operator precedence table above, we know that the exponentiation will be evaluated first. So, let’s perform that step:\n$$ -x + x - x / x * x ^ x \\% x // x $$ $$ -2 + 2 - 2 / 2 * 2 ^ 2 \\% 2 // 2 $$ $$ -2 + 2 - 2 / 2 * (2 ^ 2) \\% 2 // 2 $$ $$ -2 + 2 - 2 / 2 * 4 \\% 2 // 2 $$\nNext, we can perform the inverse operation on the first number:\n$$ (-2) + 2 - 2 / 2 * 4 \\% 2 // 2 $$ Now we can perform all of the multiplicative operations, going from left to right. So, by adding the appropriate parentheses, we’d calculate the following:\n$$ (-2) + 2 - 2 / 2 * 4 \\% 2 // 2 $$ $$ (-2) + 2 - (2 / 2) * 4 \\% 2 // 2 $$ $$ (-2) + 2 - ((2 / 2) * 4) \\% 2 // 2 $$ $$ (-2) + 2 - (((2 / 2) * 4) \\% 2) // 2 $$ $$ (-2) + 2 - ((((2 / 2) * 4) \\% 2) // 2) $$ $$ (-2) + 2 - (((1.0 * 4) \\% 2) // 2) $$ $$ (-2) + 2 - ((4.0 \\% 2) // 2) $$ $$ (-2) + 2 - (0.0 // 2) $$ $$ (-2) + 2 - 0.0 $$\nNotice that the first division operation created a floating point value. From then on, any operation containing that floating point value would also result in a floating point value, even floor division.\nFollowing that, we can perform any additive operations. Once again, we can add parentheses as appropriate to find the following:\n$$ (-2) + 2 - 0.0 $$ $$ ((-2) + 2) - 0.0 $$ $$ (((-2) + 2) - 0.0) $$ $$ (0 - 0.0) $$ $$ 0.0 $$\nOnce we’ve calculated all of the operations on the right-hand side of the assignment operator, we can then perform the assignment operation. Since we used the += assignment operator, we will add the value $ 0.0 $ to the existing value in x. So, we’d calculate $ 2 + 0.0 = 2.0 $, which will store the value $ 2.0 $ in x.\nSo, the final output from this program would be:\nNotice that the final type of x is now float, since we added a floating point value to the original int value.\nHowever, as any good math teacher will tell us, it is always better to use additional parentheses to make sure our operations are performed in the correct order instead of relying on the order of operations. So, we should definitely avoid writing code as ambiguous as the example given above.\nHuman readable code is the goal of any programming activity.\nWeb Only This content is presented in the course directly through Codio.

This isn’t just anecdotal evidence from computer science teachers like me, but theories and research from education researchers who study how humans learn new skills and abilities throughout their lives.If I had to summarize all of this information in as few words as possible, I’d simply say “do the work.” Learning to program is difficult, and the only way to really get good at it is through constant practice and learning. However, that greatly oversimplifies the information that I want to share, and I’m hoping that you’ll find some helpful takeaways from this video that you can incorporate into your learning process.\nBefore I begin, I want go give all the credit to Nathan Bean for developing this information as part of his CIS 400 course. He graciously allowed me to use his hard work here, and I encourage you to check out his original version, which is available at the URL shown on this slide.\nThe statement “do the work” is a shorter version of a very common quote from educators, which is “the person doing the work is the person doing the learning.” I couldn’t find a solid reference for who said it first, so I’ll just attributed it to various educators throughout time. This really highlights one of the biggest struggles many students run into when learning to program. There are so many guides online, and the answer to many simple problems can be found through a quick Google search. You can just copy and paste the code, and then your program works. However, did you really learn how to write that program and what it does, or just how to find a quick answer? While this may be a useful tactic from time to time, if you rely too much on other people to do your coding, you really won’t learn it yourself. This is just like learning to shoot free throws on a basketball court or beating your best time in a speedrun - you can’t just watch someone do it and expect to do it yourself (believe me, I’ve tried). So, if you aren’t doing the work, you aren’t really learning.\nNext, let’s address a major myth in computer science. I’ve heard this many times: “some people are just natural born programmers, and others simply cannot learn to program.” And yes, on the surface, it may appear to be this way. Some students just seem to have a knack for programming, and you may sit and struggle and not really get anywhere. However, there is no innate skill or ability that makes you good at programming.\nInstead, let’s reframe what it means to learn programming. At its core, programming is learning to write steps to solve problems in a way that a computer can perform those steps. That’s really what we are doing when we learn programming.\nSo, we must focus on learning how to write those steps with the proper exactitude and precision so that they make sense, and we must understand how a computer functions to be able to program that computer effectively. So, when you see someone who is good at programming, it’s not because they are good at some esoteric skill that you’ll never have - they just know how to express their steps properly and know enough about how a computer works to make their program do what they want. That’s really it! And, to be honest, after a single semester of learning to program, you’ll have all the skills you need to do both of those things! If you know how to make conditionals, loops, functions, and use simple variables and arrays, that’s really all you need. Everything else that comes after that is just refining those skills to make your programs more powerful and your coding more efficient.\nSo, how do we learn these skills? Well, there are a couple of important pieces we need to make sure are in the right place first. For starters, we need to have the correct mindset. Many times I’ll see students struggle to learn how to program, and they’ll say things like what you see on this slide. “Its too hard.” “I don’t understand this.” “I give up.” Statements like this are the sign of a “fixed mindset,” and they can be one of the greatest blockers preventing you from really learning to program. Just like learning any other skill, you have to be open to instruction and willing to learn, or else you’ve failed before you even started.\nInstead, we want to focus on building a growth mindset. In the TED talk by Carol Dweck that is linked below this video, which I encourage you to watch, she talks about the power of “yet.” We can turn these statements around by simply adding positive power of “yet” - “I don’t understand this yet.” “I love a good challenge.” “I’ll keep trying until I get it.” Going into a programming project with a mindset that is open to growth and change is really an important first steps. When I feel like I’m getting a fixed mindset, I like to think about how difficult it would be to teach a child to tie their shoes if they don’t want to learn. As soon as I realize that, it is pretty easy to recognize that same problem in myself and work to correct it.\nSo, once we have our growth mindset, how do we actually learn to program? To understand that, let’s dive a bit into the world of educational theory and the work of Jean Piaget. Piaget was a biologist and psychologist who studied how young children acquired new knowledge, and he helped pioneer the concept of Constructivism, one of the most influential philosophies in education. You can read more about Constructivism in the links below this video.\nOne particular thing that Piaget worked on was a theory of genetic epistemology. Epistemology is the term for the study of human knowledge, so genetic epistemology is the study of the origins, or genesis, of that knowledge. Put more clearly, it’s the study of how humans create new knowledge. This concept was inspired by research done on snails - he was able to prove that two previously distinct species of snails were actually the same by moving snails from one habitat to another and observing how they modified their behaviors and how their shells grew to match the snails in the new habitat. Put clearly, the snails displayed an altered behavior based on their environment. They tried to exist in equilibrium with their environment by adapting their behaviors to fit what they now experienced in the word.\nPiaget suspected that something similar happens when humans try to learn something - the brain tries to adapt itself to maintain an equilibrium in its environment, which in this case is the existing knowledge it contains. So, when the brain is exposed to new ideas, it must somehow adjust to account for that new information. Piaget proposed two different mechanisms for how this occurs: assimilation and accommodation. In assimilation, new knowledge can be added to existing structures in the brain. For example, if you are exposed to a new color, such as periwinkle, you can see that it falls somewhere between blue and violet, two colors you already know. So, you can assimilate that new knowledge into the existing knowledge without a major disruption to your mental structure of existing colors. Accommodation, on the other hand, happens when your brain must radically adapt to new information for which no existing structures exist. This can be very difficult, and can lead to a lot of struggle and frustration when trying to get “over the hump” on a new subject. Think about learning algebra or a new language for the first time - you really don’t have anything you can use to help understand this new material, so you just have to keep at it until those new structures are formed in your brain.\nUnfortunately, to achieve accommodation, your brain simply has to build brand new structures to store and represent all of this new information, and that process is difficult and takes time. Put another way, it takes significant stimulus, usually in the form of doing homework, struggling with difficult problems and wrestling with the new information to try and understand it all, to create enough disequilibrium in your brain that, coupled with a growth mindset, will allow accommodation to occur. However, when all the pieces are in the right place, and you work hard and have a growth mindset, then…\nEUREKA! The structures will form, and you’ll get over that huge hurdle, and things will start falling into place. It may not happen all at once, but it does happen (you’ve probably had it happen to you several times already - think about some eureka moments from your past - were they related to learning a new skill?). Of course, there’s a good chance that your brain might form a few incorrect structures in the process, so you’ll have to overcome those as you continue to learn. I still struggle to spell some words because my brain formed incorrect structures when I was still learning. But, if you continue to work hard and be open to learning, you’ll eventually sort those errors out as well.\nLet’s look at one other concept in education, which is called stage theory. Piaget identified four stages that children go through as they learn to reason about the world. Those four stages are shown on this slide. In the sensorimotor stage, the child is just using their senses to interact with the world, without any real understanding of what will happen when they perform an action. This is best represented by babies and toddlers, who touch and taste everything in their surroundings. Next, the preoperational stage is represented in young children as they start to think symbolically about the world, using pictures and words to represent actions and objects. They then progress to the concrete operational stage, where they can begin to think logically and understand how concrete events happen. They can also start to think inductively, building the general principles of the world from their specific experiences. For example, if they observe that cooked spaghetti is better than raw spaghetti, they might reason that other foods like potatoes are better cooked than raw. Finally, the last stage is the formal operational stage. This stage is represented by the ability to work fully with an abstract work, formulating and testing hypotheses to truly understand how the world works and predict how new items will work before experiencing them firsthand.\nMany later researchers built upon this model to show that adults learn in much the same way. They also discovered that the stages are not rigid, and you may exhibit behaviors from multiple stages at any given time. This is called the “overlapping waves” model, and is shown here in this diagram. So, as you learn new skills, you may be at the operational stage in some areas, but still at the preoperational stage in other areas. This explains why some concepts may make sense while others don’t for a while - you just have to keep going until it all fits together.\nSo, how can we apply all of this information to programming? One theory comes from the work of Lister and Teague, who proposed a developmental epistemology of computer programming. Put another way, they applied this theory to computer science education, and gave us a unique way to think about the different stages of learning to program.\nAt the sensorimotor stage, we’re just getting the basics. So, when given a piece of code and asked to trace what it does, we still make lots of errors and get the answer incorrect. If we want to get a program to work ourselves, it usually involves a lot of trial and error, and many times when it does end up working we don’t even know exactly why it worked that time, but we’re building up a baseline of information that we can use to construct our mental model of how a computer works.\nAs we progress into the preoperational stage, we become better at tracing code correctly, but we still struggle to understand what the program itself does. We see each line of code as a separate instruction, but not the entire program. A great analogy is reading a recipe that calls for flour, water, salt, and yeast. Will it make bread? Biscuits? Pie crust? We’re not sure yet, but at least we can recognize the ingredients. To solve problems at this stage, we typically will randomly adjust pieces of our code that we don’t quite understand and see what it does, trying to form a better idea of the importance of each line in the code.\nEventually, we’ll get to the concrete operational stage. At this stage, we can construct our own programs, but many times we are simply piecing together parts that we’ve used before and performing some futile patches and bugfixes as we refine the program. We can also work backwards to figure out what a program does from execution results, but we still aren’t very good at deducing the results from the code itself. However, we’re starting to work with abstraction, though we tend to simplify things to a level that we are more comfortable with.\nFinally, we’ll reach the formal operational stage. At this stage, we can comfortable read and understand code without executing it, quickly seeing what it does and how it works without fully tracing it ourselves. We can also start to form hypotheses for how to build new programs and code, and reason about whether different approaches would work better or worse than others. This is the goal stage for any programmer! Once you have reached this stage, then you’ll feel totally at home working in code and developing your own programs from scratch.\nSo, how can we enable ourselves to be the best learners we can be? There is lots of interesting research in that area, best summarized in the book “The New Science of Learning” that is linked below this video. Let’s go through a few of the big concepts.\nFirst, getting ample and regular sleep is important, because it allows your brain to build those knowledge structures we discussed earlier and store the memories from the day in long-term storage. Without enough sleep, your brain is unable to process memories offline and make them ready for retrieval later on, an important step in learning. Also, consuming large amounts of caffeine or alcohol can disrupt your sleep patterns, so keep that in mind before you pour that next cup of coffee or go out partying. You can also take advantage of modern technology to help you track your sleep - most smart watches and smartphones today can help with that!\nLikewise, regular exercise is important to both your physical and mental health. When you exercise, especially aerobic exercise that gets your heart rate up, your body releases neurochemicals that help your brain cells communicate. In addition, just getting up and moving around regularly helps keep your body healthy, so take regular breaks, and consider getting a standing desk for some extra benefits.\nResearch also shows that engaging your senses is an important part in learning. This is why we, as teachers, try to vary our lessons with pictures, videos, activities, and more. It is also the basis of the cognitive apprenticeship style of learning that we use, which you can learn more about in the links below this video. We show you the code we are writing, engaging your sense of vision, while talking about it so you are also listening, and then you are writing your own version, using your sense of touch. You can build upon this by using your senses while you learn by taking notes during a lecture video, building concept maps, and even printing out and writing on your code and these lecture scripts. All of these processes help engage different parts of your brain and make it that much easier to build new knowledge structures.\nLooking for patterns is another important way to understand programming. There are many common patterns in computer programs, such as using a for loop to iterate through an array, or an if-else statement to determine if a particular variable is set to a valid value. By recognizing and understanding those patterns, we can more quickly understand new programs that use slightly different versions of the same code. Humans are naturally very good at pattern recognition, and it is one of the reasons why we see the same code structures time and time again - not because they are the only way to accomplish that goal, but because that structure is commonly used across many programs and therefore is easier to understand.\nThere is quite a bit of research into how memories are formed and how we can adjust our studying habits to take advantage of that. For example, cognitive science shows that the parts of our brain responsible for memory creation are active up to one hour after a learning experience has ended, such as a lecture video or activity. So, instead of jumping to the next task, you may want to take a little while to reflect on what you just did and let it sink in before moving on. Likewise, to build strong memories, it is important to constantly recall the memory or use the skills you’ve learned to strengthen their structures in the brain. This is why teachers like to throw in a few questions from a previous exam or quiz every once in a while - it helps strengthen those structures by forcing you to recall information you’ve learned previously. On the other hand, many students try to “cram” a bunch of information right before an exam, only to forget it soon after because it wasn’t recalled more than once. As you progress further, we’ll continue to come back to concepts you’ve already learned and build upon them, a process called elaboration that helps reinforce what you’ve already learned while building new, related knowledge.\nFinally, it is important to remember that we must give our brains the space it needs to focus on the task at hand. Multitasking while learning, such as watching YouTube or Twitch, chatting with friends, or listening to a lecture video while coding can all reduce your brain’s ability to form strong memories and do well. In fact, research shows that individuals who try to multitask tend to make 50% more errors and spend 50% more time on both tasks. So, instead of giving yourself distractions, try to find things that will help you focus better - there are some great playlists online for music without lyrics that can help you focus or code better, and you can easily mute notifications on your phone and on your computer for an hour or so while you work.\nSo, let’s summarize what we’ve covered here. First, and most importantly, remember that you can learn to program, just like the many students who have done it before you. However, it can be difficult and frustrating at times, and it will take lots of hard work on your part to make it happen. That means that you’ll need to read and write a lot of code before it really starts to make sense. In short, you must do the work to learn to program.\nThat said, you can help make the process easier by getting good sleep, exercising regularly, and engaging fully with all of the content in the course. That means you’ll need to take your own notes, maybe draw some diagrams, and annotate code you write and code you read to help you understand it. While you are working, try not to multitask so you can focus. If you are given some code to include in your program, don’t copy/paste it - rewrite it, and make sure you completely understand what each line does. Finally, take some time to read code written by others! GitHub is a great place to discover all sorts of code and see how others write code. If you want to write good poetry you have to read lots of good poetry, and the same goes for coding.\nWith that in mind, I hope you are able to make the best of this course and continue to develop your programming skills. If you are interested in this topic and would like to know more about things you can do to be a better learner, let us know! As you can imagine, teachers like me love to talk about this stuff, so don’t be afraid to ask. Good luck!\n",

    "content": "Once we have data stored in our programs, there are a number of ways we can manipulate that data. Let’s look at a few of them here.\nBasic Operations At its core, a computer is capable of performing all of the basic arithmetic operations, so we can write programs that can add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers. However, there is one big caveat that must be dealt with.\nAs discussed on the previous page, computer programs can store numbers as both integers and floating point numbers. What happens when we perform operations on two different types of numbers? For example, if an integer is added to a floating point number, would the resulting number be an integer or a floating point number, as in $ 1 + 1.5 $?\nAs our intuition suggests, performing the operation gives us $ 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 $, which is a floating point number. In general, when performing an operation on either two integers or two floating point numbers, the result will match the type of the two operands. However, when performing an operation on both an integer and a floating point number, the result is a floating point number.\nThere are two notable exceptions to this rule:\nIn a strongly-typed programming language, such as Java, the result may be converted to match the type of the variable it is being stored in, if allowed by the language. When dividing two integers, the result may be either a floating point number or an integer, depending on the language. We’ll discuss both of these exceptions later in this chapter when we dig into the details for each programming language.\nNew Operations YouTube Video\nVideo Materials\nIn addition to the basic operations listed above that we are all familiar with from our mathematics class, there are a few new operations we should be aware of as well.\nModulo The first new operation, the modulo operation, finds the remainder after dividing two numbers. It is typically written as $ 9 \\bmod 5 $ when printed, but most programming languages use the percent sign %, as in 9 % 5 to refer to this operation.\nTo calculate the result of the modulo operation, we must look back to long division. In the example above, we can calculate $ 9 \\bmod 5 $ by first calculating $ 9 / 5 $, which is $ 1 $ with a remainder of $ 4 $. So, the result of $ 9 \\bmod 5 $ is $ 4 $.\nAnother way to think about the modulo operation is to simply find the largest multiple of the second operand that is smaller than the first, and then subtract the two, just like you do when performing long division. So, we can find $ 42 \\bmod 13 $ by first calculating the largest multiple of $ 13 $ that is smaller than $ 42 $, which is $ 39 $, or $ 13 * 3 $. Then, we can subtract $ 42 - 39 = 3 $, so $ 42 \\bmod 13 = 3 $.\nThe modulo operation is very important in many areas of programming. In fact, it is one of the core operations for most modern forms of encryption!\nModulo \u0026 Negative Numbers The modulo operation is not consistently defined when applied to negative numbers. Therefore, each programming language may return a slightly different result when performing this operation on a negative number. Make sure you carefully consider how this operation is used, and consult the official documentation for your programming language or test the operation if you aren’t sure how it will work.\nTruncated \u0026 Floor Division As discussed a bit earlier, one of the stranger things in programming is dealing with division. When dividing two integers, it is possible to end up with a result that is a floating point number, as in $ 9 / 8 = 1.125 $. So, how should we handle this?\nIt turns out that each programming language may handle it a bit differently. For example, Java would truncate the result by removing everything after the decimal point to make the result an integer. So, in Java, the statements 99 / 100 and -99 / 100 would both usually evaluate to 0. However, we can force the result to be a floating point number by making sure that at least one of the operands is a floating point number, as well as the variable we are storing the result in.\nPython, on the other hand, would store the result as a floating point number by default if needed. However, Python also includes a special operator, known as floor division or //, that would round the result down. For positive numbers, this means that the result would be rounded toward 0, while negative numbers would be rounded away from 0. So, in Python, the statement 99 // 100 would evaluate to 0 since it is rounded toward 0, while -99 // 100 would evaluate to -1 since it is rounded away from 0.\nIn short, we just need to pay special attention when we use the division operation to make sure we get the result we expect.\nAssignment \u0026 Equality Lastly, we should briefly discuss the assignment operator. We’ve already come across it earlier in this chapter. In mathematics, we usually use the equals sign = to denote equality, as in $ x + 5 = 10 $.\nIn programming, we use the single equals sign = to perform assignment. This allows us to store a value into a variable, as in x = 5. This would store the value $ 5 $ into the variable x. We could also say that we assign the value $ 5 $ to x.\nHowever, it is very important to note that the variable we are assigning a value to goes first, on the left side of the equals sign. So, we cannot say 5 = x in most programming languages.\nEquality Most programming languages use a double equals sign, or == to denote equality. We’ll learn more about equality and other comparison operators in a later chapter.\n",

At this juncture let’s trace the execution SomeProgram.java as if the command line where java SomeProgram 2 3.\n1: public class SomeProgram{ 2: public static void main(String[] args){ 3: System.out.println(\"args[0] is a String\"); 4: System.out.println(\"args[0]'s value is '\"+args[0]+\"'\"); 5: int x = Integer.parseInt(args[0]); 6: System.out.println(\"x is a int\"); 7: System.out.println(\"x's value is \"+ x); 8: int y = Integer.parseInt(args[1]); 9: int z = x + y; 10: System.out.println(x + \" + \" + y + \" = \" + z); 11: } 12:} When we run this program we start on line 2, the beginning of the main method. The array {\"2\", \"3\"} is assigned to args print that args[0] is a String, we know this because args is declared to be an array of Strings (String[] args, line 2) print the value of the string at index 0 of the array args convert the string args[0] to an int, assign that int-value to x print that x is an int, we know this because x is declared to be an int (int x, line 5) print the value of x convert the string args[1] to an int, assign that int-value to y add x and y, assign that sum to the int z final print The trace of this program is { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }. As you may recall from CC 110 , being able to trace the execution of code by hand is key to ensuring complete test case coverage and successful de-bugging. More on tracing in module 4.\nWe encourage you to experiment with SomeProgram.java. What happens if you give too few arguments, too many, the wrong types (the word “cat” for 2), etc.\nStaring at 0 saves memory and simplifies memory access. Nearly all languages start at 0. ↩︎\n",

    "content": " The Linux command line consists of the command and the arguments.\nIn our case the command, the word Linux translates into action, is “python3”. Everything else is packaged up as string-values and sent to the Python3 interpreter.\nPython Interpreter and the Command-line Arguments The Python3 interpreter does different things based on what it receives from Linux as arguments. If it receives no arguments it starts the Python3 Read-Evaluate-PrintLine (REPL). This is an interactive session of Python3 which can be exited with the command quit().\npython3 -h brings up all the various options for using the command python3.1\nNotice towards the bottom “file : program read from script file”. This is the way you will typically use the python3 command in CC 210.\nAccessing Command-line Arguments in a Object Oriented Program Inside the Python3 interpreter, the command line arguments are mapped (assigned) to a special variable in the sys module called sys.argv2. sys.argv is a list of strings.\n1 import sys 2 class SomeProgram: 3 @staticmethod 4 def main(args): 5 # Your code Below 6 # Your code above 7 if __name__ == \"__main__\": 8 SomeProgram.main(sys.argv) In the starter code, line 1 tells the Python interpreter we want access to the sys module of methods and variables. Line 8 sends sys.argv to the main method as an argument.\nInside of main, the parameter(variable) named args is mapped to the values of sys.argv. In effect, inside of the main method, args becomes a alias for sys.argv.\nPython OOP Convention In many languages, argv is essentially read-only, it cannot be altered. This allows multiple files of a complex program to access to the command-line arguments with the assurance that they have not been altered by some other code. Unfortunately, Python does not really support the idea of constant (unchangeable) user defined data. So BY CONVENTION, no class method should ever assign to sys.argv or its aliases:\nx ← args[0] OK, `args` can appear on the Right Hand side of an assignment ars[0] ← \"new string\" BAD, `args` should never appear on the Left Hand side of an assignment Always pass in sys.argv as a parameter. Never directly access sys.argv from inside a class definition (body).\nAccessing arguments args[0] is always the name of the file being run. Additional command line arguments are space (tab) separated. args is always a list of strings, in the order they appeared on the command line.\nYou can add the line print (args) to main to see the list of elements (the values) in the list args. As a reminder, you can access any element of a list by\nlist_name [ index_number ] Converting arguments args is always a list of strings. Programmers convert args-elements (values in the args-list) to the appropriate type. This is typically done using int() or float(), see the Python Documentation.\nSomeProgram.py A proper command line for running SomeProgram.py would be python3 SomeProgram.py \u003cint\u003e \u003cint\u003e or python3 SomeProgram.py 2 3. At this juncture let’s trace the execution SomeProgram.py as if the command line where python3 SomeProgram.py 2 3.\n1: import sys 2: 3: class SomeProgram: 4: 5: @staticmethod 6: def main(args): 7: # Your code Below 8: print(\"args[1] = {} is type {}\".format(args[1],type(args[1]))) 9: x = int(args[1]) 10: print(\"x = {} is type {}\".format(x,type(x))) 11: y = int(args[2]) 12: z = x + y 13: print(\"z is {}\".format(z)) 14: # Your code above 15: 16: # Main Guard 17: if __name__ == \"__main__\": 18: SomeProgram.main(sys.argv) 19: We start with line 1, importing the sys module. {1} The next line to execute is line 17, the Main Guard {1,17} A properly written class definition (class body) will contain no executable lines when read Because we are “running” SomeProgram.py from the terminal, the Main Guard is true and we goto the function call for SomeProgram.main() {1,17,18} We jump to the function definition `{1, 17, 18, 6}`` at this point args[0] is sys.argv[0] and equals “SomeProgram.py” at this point args[1] is sys.argv[1] and equals “2” at this point args[2] is sys.argv[2] and equals “3” We call print at line 8 {1, 17, 18, 6, 8} args[1] = 2 is type class-str On line 9, we call int on args[1], which returns the integer value 2 and we assign 2 to x {1, 17, 18, 6, 8, 9 } x now equals 2 We call print() at line 10 {1, 17, 18, 6, 8, 9, 10 } x = 2 is type class-int On line 11, we call int on args[2], which returns the integer value 2 and we assign 2 to x {1, 17, 18, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 } y now equals 3 We now add the values of x and y (so … 5) and assign that value to z {1, 17, 18, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 } z equals 5 We hit the print() call at line 13 {1, 17, 18, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 } z is 5 We hit the end of the function and jump back to were we came from (line 18){1, 17, 18, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 (18) } We are done with line 18 so we go to 19, the end of the program. {1, 17, 18, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 (18), 19 } The trace of this program would typically be shortened to {... 17, 18, call 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, return 19 }. As you may recall from CC 110 , being able to trace the execution of code by hand is key to ensuring complete test case coverage and successful de-bugging. More on tracing in module 4.\nWe encourage you to experiment with SomeProgram.py. What happens if you give too few arguments, too many, the wrong types (the word “cat” for 2), etc.\n-? are often referred to as flags, as in the ‘dash v’ (-v) flag will print out the version number. ↩︎\nthis stands for argument vector and comes from the earliest high level programming languages ↩︎\n",

    "content": "CC 210 Is 4 Credit Hours The University guidance is you should spend 12 hours per week on a 4 credit hour course. We interpret this to mean twelve 50 minute sessions and assume you spend some time studying and reviewing class materials which is not captured in Codio. Historically, average students come close to this goal, with some weeks going over and the early weeks being low.\nCaveats:\nWe assume that when given two weeks for a project, the “effort” is split equally between both weeks. Students learn different concepts at different rates – your effort may vary Substantially more effort is required to be successful in CC 210 than in CC 110.\nModules 1 - 5 Are Mostly Review Non Python Students If you are taking CC 210 in a language other than Python, Modules 1 - 5 will quickly introduce you to the basic control statements and variable types in your selected language. The concepts will be familiar but the application may be a bit more advanced than that which was covered in CC 110.\nPython Students If you are taking CC 210 in Python, Modules 1 - 5 may seem like total review. However, we introduce syntactical and semantic options that, for simplicity’s sake, were omitted from CC 110.\nDo not become complacent based on the first 3 weeks of course work. This course will become more difficult quickly.\nCC 210 Projects vs CC 110 Homeworks and Labs CUT and PASTE in PROJECTS is Forbidden We want you to use the Codio editor for your Projects. It is deliberately feature poor to emphasize the student’s knowledge of the language, not the editor’s fancy assistance. See your syllabus, but in general a project which has materials copied/pasted in may receive a 0.\nNote: Although cut and paste are permitted in TUTORIALs, plagiarism is not. DO NOT paste in someone else’s work.\n“Check-It” Buttons may not be Comprehensive You must develop and test your projects from the terminal. In CC 110, the student assessment button ran the same test software that the grader did; thus your score on the “Check-it” button was a true indication of your Codio grade.\nIn CC 210, the “Check-it” button may be only a small subset the tests run for your Codio grade, so just because you pass those tests does not mean that your project is complete. This also does not guarantee you will receive a passing grade from the actual grader run after you submit your project. It is your job to test your code thoroughly in the terminal and develop your own test cases.\nAll Work is Subject to Manual review Your submitted project may be reviewed manual for structure, forbidden commands, proper function from the terminal, etc. Please see your syllabus.\nAs a result your the score you receive from Codio may not reflect your final score. Here is the estimated points workflow:\nThe Autograder assigns a grade in Codio and LMS software (e.g. Canvas). Manual review may deduct some points – see syllabus. Plagiarism detection is run and penalties applied. Late penalties may be applied. ",

    "content": "An object oriented program contains lots of additional syntax that instructs the compiler or interpreter^[We are going to just use compiler for simplicity’s sake] to impose certain conditions when creating the machine- or byte-code. We will address the details of this syntax after you have learned the necessary background, until then we will just give you the code.\nEverything Is In a Class Classes are the blueprints of objects. In an object oriented program everything is inside a class definition. In this class, every file will contain exactly class definition or class-body.\n# Pseudo Code CLASS \u003cidentifier\u003e{ class-body } // Java public class \u003cidentifier\u003e { class-body } # Python class \u003cidentifier\u003e: class-body Code Block Delimiters The class-definition is a “code-block.” Code-blocks signal a boundary to the compiler. This helps the compiler manage identifier names, memory and other things.\nCode-blocks are delimited, or set apart by various symbols. In Java and pseudo code, this is done with brackets { code block }. Spacing is often also used to make the code more readable, everything a block lines up.\nIn Python each code block is indented to the right; in this class we will use 4-spaces. When a line ends with a colon, Python expects the next line to be the start of a new code block (and therefore indented).\npublic class Foo{ statement one statement two } public class Bar{ statement_three } class Foo: statement_one statement_two class Bar: statement_three In the preceding examples, statement_one and statement_two are the code block for class-Foo’s definition.\nEvery Program Starts Somewhere By tradition (and by rule in many languages) object oriented programs start in a method called main().\n# Pseudo Code CLASS \u003cclass identifier\u003e{ FUCNTION main(){ function-body } } // Java public class \u003cclass identifier\u003e { publlic static void main(String[] args){ method-body } } # Python class \u003cclass identifier\u003e: @classmethod def main(args): method-body For the first several modules, all of the code you need to write will be in the method-body for main().

You should receive a response within one business day, and hopefully much sooner. Note emailing the instructor or teaching assistants directly may result in longer wait times for your support. Prerequisites C or better in CC 110 - Introduction to Computing (Prerequisite or Concurrent Enrollment with instructor permission) Course Overview Basic concepts in developing computer programs: program structure and syntax, primitive data types, variables, control flow, iteration, simple algorithms, debugging, and good software development practices. Introduction to object-oriented programming.\nCourse Description The course introduces students to computer programming using one of several programming languages. Interactive lessons and engaging projects reinforce new skills and concepts while relating programming fundamentals to the real world. This course covers the basic concepts of programming, from variables and control flow to functions, objects, and simple algorithms.\nLearning Objectives In either Java or Python (J or P), successful students should be able to:\nEvaluate data requirements to create variables, use operators and call/create functions for: strings, integers, real numbers and Boolean values. Understand the creation and use of mono-typed Lists (P) or Arrays (J) and their common built in methods and attributes. Analyze and adapt string methods to split, join and extract sub-strings to solve problems. Understand how code written by them may throw exceptions Understand how to create new exceptions Understand and adapt exception handling structures Understand how to create programs that read-from and write-to text files. Analyze and create conditional statement to control program execution Analyze and create loops to control program execution Analyze and adapt methods/function to control program execution Remember to consider separation of concerns when creating methods Understand how to create instance-based classes to include public/private access of components attributes, properties and methods inheritance Understand how to adapt Boolean equations to common natural language problem statements Understand how to adapt class APIs to incorporate objects in solutions Analyze medium-to-low-level designs expressed as text-based program requirements to create programs including: UML Class diagrams, flow charts and pseudo code Create terminal or console based programs Major Course Topics Programming Basics Primitive Data Types Boolean Logic and Boolean Algebra Conditional Statements Loops Arrays / Lists Strings, String Parsing, and String Formatting Exception Handling and Debugging Console and File I/O Methods, Arguments and Parameters Classes and Objects Object-Oriented Programming Model-View-Controller Architecture Inheritance and Polymorphism Standard Library/Module Collections and generic types Course Structure This course is intended to be taught 100% online, each module is self-paced, and each module must be completed to progress to the next one. Students are expected to make good progress; we have found students who fall behind often fail to successfully complete the class. In general, one or more modules are assigned each week. There are 3 weeks where no new module is assigned. This is a strong indication that the previous week’s module takes a lot of time (modules 7, 10 and 12). Modules will contain recorded videos, online tutorials, text and links to online resources. Each module will include a coding project or assignment, many of which will be graded automatically through Codio. You will be asked to pick a language by the end of the first week (Java or Python) at which point you will be invited to a language specific Canvas course. All content is accessed through this second Canvas course.\nGrading Each student starts with 0 points in the gradebook and works upward toward a final point total earned out of the possible number of points. In this course, each assignment constitutes a portion of the final grade, as detailed below: 70% - Codio Programming Projects 30% - Codio Tutorials and Canvas Quizzes\nLetter grades will be assigned following the standard scale:\n90% - 100% → A 80% - 89.99% → B 70% - 79.99% → C 60% - 69.99% → D 00% - 59.99% → F Late Work Warning Read this late work policy very carefully! If you are unsure how to interpret it, please contact the instructors via the help email. Not understanding the policy does not mean that it won’t apply to you!\nSince this course is entirely online, students may work at any time and at their own pace through the modules. However, to keep everyone on track, there will be approximately one module due each week. Each graded item in the module will have a specific due date specified. Any assignment submitted late will have that assignment’s grade reduced by 10% of the total possible points on that project for each day it is late. This penalty will be assessed automatically in the Canvas gradebook.\nEven if a module is not submitted on time, it must still be completed before a student is allowed to begin the next module. So, students should take care not to get too far behind, as it may be very difficult to catch up.\nFinally, all course work must be submitted on or before the last day of the semester in which the student is enrolled in the course in order for it to be graded on time.\nIf you have extenuating circumstances, please discuss them with the instructor as soon as they arise so other arrangements can be made. If you find that you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to make up missed work.\nIncomplete Policy Students should strive to complete this course in its entirety before the end of the semester in which they are enrolled. However, since retaking the course would be costly and repetitive for students, we would like to give students a chance to succeed with a little help rather than immediately fail students who are struggling.\nIf you are unable to complete the course in a timely manner, please contact the instructor to discuss an incomplete grade. Incomplete grades are given solely at the instructor’s discretion. See the official K-State Grading Policy for more information. In general, poor time management alone is not a sufficient reason for an incomplete grade.\nUnless otherwise noted in writing on a signed Incomplete Agreement Form, the following stipulations apply to any incomplete grades given in Computational Core courses:\nStudents may receive at most two incompletes in Computational Core courses throughout their time in the program Students will be given 6 calendar weeks from the end of the enrolled semester’s finals week to complete the course Any modules in a future CC course which depend on incomplete work will not be accessible until the previous course is finished For example, if a student is given an incomplete in CC 210, then all modules in CC 310 will be inaccessible until CC 210 is complete Students understand that access to instructor and GTA assistance may be limited after the end of an academic semester due to holidays and other obligations If a student fails to resolve an incomplete grade after 6 weeks, they will be assigned an ‘F’ in the course. In addition, they will be dropped from any other Computational Core courses which require the failed course as a prerequisite or corequisite. Recommended Texts \u0026 Supplies To participate in this course, students must have access to a modern web browser and broadband internet connection. All course materials will be provided via Canvas and Codio. Modules may also contain links to external resources for additional information, such as programming language documentation.\nSubject to Change The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students.\nWarning Effective 9/26/2022: Due to rampant plagiarism, the copying and pasting of code is no longer allowed. All coding must be done in the Codio IDE. Moving forward, if you paste any code into Codio (other than code which is explicitly given as starter code) you will receive an XF. The X indicates that academic dishonesty occurred and the F indicates that you failed the course.\nStandard Syllabus Statements Info The statements below are standard syllabus statements from K-State and our program. The latest versions are available online here.\nAcademic Honesty Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one’s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the Honor and Integrity System apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: “On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.” A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.\nFor this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result in sanctions such as a 0 on the assignment or an XF in the course, depending on severity. Actively seeking unauthorized aid, such as posting lab assignments on sites such as Chegg or StackOverflow or asking another person to complete your work, even if unsuccessful, will result in an immediate XF in the course.\nWe reserve the right to use various platforms that can perform automatic plagiarism detection by tracking changes made to files and comparing submitted projects against other students’ submissions and known solutions. That information may be used to determine if plagiarism has taken place.\nStudents with Disabilities At K-State it is important that every student has access to course content and the means to demonstrate course mastery. Students with disabilities may benefit from services including accommodations provided by the Student Access Center. Disabilities can include physical, learning, executive functions, and mental health. You may register at the Student Access Center or to learn more contact:\nManhattan/Olathe/Global Campus – Student Access Center accesscenter@k-state.edu 785-532-6441 K-State Salina Campus – Julie Rowe; Student Success Coordinator jarowe@k-state.edu 785-820-7908 Students already registered with the Student Access Center please request your Letters of Accommodation early in the semester to provide adequate time to arrange your approved academic accommodations. Once SAC approves your Letter of Accommodation it will be e-mailed to you, and your instructor(s) for this course. Please follow up with your instructor to discuss how best to implement the approved accommodations.\nExpectations for Conduct All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class. Mutual Respect and Inclusion in K-State Teaching \u0026 Learning Spaces At K-State, faculty and staff are committed to creating and maintaining an inclusive and supportive learning environment for students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. K-State courses, labs, and other virtual and physical learning spaces promote equitable opportunity to learn, participate, contribute, and succeed, regardless of age, race, color, ethnicity, nationality, genetic information, ancestry, disability, socioeconomic status, military or veteran status, immigration status, Indigenous identity, gender identity, gender expression, sexuality, religion, culture, as well as other social identities.\nFaculty and staff are committed to promoting equity and believe the success of an inclusive learning environment relies on the participation, support, and understanding of all students. Students are encouraged to share their views and lived experiences as they relate to the course or their course experience, while recognizing they are doing so in a learning environment in which all are expected to engage with respect to honor the rights, safety, and dignity of others in keeping with the K-State Principles of Community.\nIf you feel uncomfortable because of comments or behavior encountered in this class, you may bring it to the attention of your instructor, advisors, and/or mentors. If you have questions about how to proceed with a confidential process to resolve concerns, please contact the Student Ombudsperson Office. Violations of the student code of conduct can be reported here. If you experience bias or discrimination, it can be reported here.\nNetiquette Info This is our personal policy and not a required syllabus statement from K-State. It has been adapted from this statement from K-State Global Campus, and the Recurse Center Manual. We have adapted their ideas to fit this course.\nOnline communication is inherently different than in-person communication. When speaking in person, many times we can take advantage of the context and body language of the person speaking to better understand what the speaker means, not just what is said. This information is not present when communicating online, so we must be much more careful about what we say and how we say it in order to get our meaning across.\nHere are a few general rules to help us all communicate online in this course, especially while using tools such as Canvas or Discord:\nUse a clear and meaningful subject line to announce your topic. Subject lines such as “Question” or “Problem” are not helpful. Subjects such as “Logic Question in Project 5, Part 1 in Java” or “Unexpected Exception when Opening Text File in Python” give plenty of information about your topic. Use only one topic per message. If you have multiple topics, post multiple messages so each one can be discussed independently. Be thorough, concise, and to the point. Ideally, each message should be a page or less. Include exact error messages, code snippets, or screenshots, as well as any previous steps taken to fix the problem. It is much easier to solve a problem when the exact error message or screenshot is provided. If we know what you’ve tried so far, we can get to the root cause of the issue more quickly. Consider carefully what you write before you post it. Once a message is posted, it becomes part of the permanent record of the course and can easily be found by others. If you are lost, don’t know an answer, or don’t understand something, speak up! Email and Canvas both allow you to send a message privately to the instructors, so other students won’t see that you asked a question. Don’t be afraid to ask questions anytime, as you can choose to do so without any fear of being identified by your fellow students. Class discussions are confidential. Do not share information from the course with anyone outside of the course without explicit permission. Do not quote entire message chains; only include the relevant parts. When replying to a previous message, only quote the relevant lines in your response. Do not use all caps. It makes it look like you are shouting. Use appropriate text markup (bold, italics, etc.) to highlight a point if needed. No feigning surprise. If someone asks a question, saying things like “I can’t believe you don’t know that!” are not helpful, and only serve to make that person feel bad. No “well-actually’s.” If someone makes a statement that is not entirely correct, resist the urge to offer a “well, actually…” correction, especially if it is not relevant to the discussion. If you can help solve their problem, feel free to provide correct information, but don’t post a correction just for the sake of being correct. Do not correct someone’s grammar or spelling. Again, it is not helpful, and only serves to make that person feel bad. If there is a genuine mistake that may affect the meaning of the post, please contact the person privately or let the instructors know privately so it can be resolved. Avoid subtle -isms and microaggressions. Avoid comments that could make others feel uncomfortable based on their personal identity. See the syllabus section on Diversity and Inclusion above for more information on this topic. If a comment makes you uncomfortable, please contact the instructor. Avoid sarcasm, flaming, advertisements, lingo, trolling, doxxing, and other bad online habits. They have no place in an academic environment. Tasteful humor is fine, but sarcasm can be misunderstood. As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates by adhering to the K-State Principles of Community.\nFace Coverings Kansas State University strongly encourages, but does not require, that everyone wear masks while indoors on university property, including while attending in-person classes. For additional information and the latest on K-State’s face covering policy, see this page. Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Harassment Kansas State University is committed to maintaining academic, housing, and work environments that are free of discrimination, harassment, and sexual harassment. Instructors support the University’s commitment by creating a safe learning environment during this course, free of conduct that would interfere with your academic opportunities. Instructors also have a duty to report any behavior they become aware of that potentially violates the University’s policy prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and sexual harassment ( PPM 3010).\nIf a student is subjected to discrimination, harassment, or sexual harassment, they are encouraged to make a non-confidential report to the University’s Office for Institutional Equity (OIE) using the online reporting form. Incident disclosure is not required to receive resources at K-State. Reports that include domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, should be considered for reporting by the complainant to the Kansas State University Police Department or the Riley County Police Department. Reports made to law enforcement are separate from reports made to OIE. A complainant can choose to report to one or both entities. Confidential support and advocacy can be found with the K-State Center for Advocacy, Response, and Education (CARE).

    "content": "That’s it! We’ve completed this unit in Codio, and we are now on the last page.\nThere’s just one more thing to do: we need to mark the unit as complete. When we do that, Codio will grade our work and then send the grade to Canvas. Once the grade is recorded in Canvas, we’ll get access to the next item in the module.\nTake a Breather Once you’ve marked a unit complete in Codio, it may take several minutes for the grading process to complete and for your grade to appear in Canvas. So, if you immediately try to access the next item in the module, you may not have access until Codio has submitted your grade to Canvas.\nSo, once you’ve marked a unit as complete, it’s a great time to take a quick breather, leave your computer behind, refill your beverage of choice, and clear your mind while Codio and Canvas handle the grading. By the time you get back, your grade should appear in Canvas and you’ll be ready to go.\nIf your grade doesn’t appear in Canvas after several minutes, please send a message to the instructors via your class’s help system.\nThere are several ways to mark a unit as complete. First and foremost, the last page of the guide in each project should have a “Mark as Completed” button at the bottom of the page, but these textbook tutorials don’t. So, once we see that button, we’ll know we’ve reached the end of a project.\nOn the tutorials, we can click the gear icon in the upper-right of the page, and select “Mark as Completed” there. It should also be available in the tutorials as well.\nFinally, we can find a “Mark as Completed” option on the Education menu at the top of the window. Each of these will perform the same function, so we can use any one of them when we are finished with our work.\nThe Codio Documentation gives several different ways that it can be done.\nOf course, don’t forget the warning on the previous page - we should make sure we are completely done with the unit before marking it as complete.\nSo, let’s go ahead and mark this unit as complete by clicking the “Mark as Completed” option found by clicking the gear icon above, or the Education menu at the top. Once we do that, we’ll be able to complete the final few things in Canvas for this module, and then we can move on to Module 1 - Hello World!\n",

    "content": "Operation Computer Science, thus programming, has its roots in Mathematics and uses a lot math technical jargon. Unfortunately this means you need to be familiar with some of this jargon.\nAn operation is a fancy math term for “do something”, but carries with it its own set of vocabulary. An operation is composed of:\nan operator (one or more symbols) operands (one or more pieces of data) a semantic meaning (i.e. what the operator does) Binary Operations Binary operations operate on two inputs. This class of operations should be familiar from arithmetic. Its format is\noperand1 operator operand2 2 + 4 x + y where the operator is typically some type of symbol.\nOperator symbols are typically overloaded in programming languages; they do different things based on the types of the operands. For example, a typical language might do the following base on the plus sign.\nType Operand 1 Type Operand 2 Result Type int 2 int 4 int 6 int 2 float 4.0 float 6.0 float 1.1 float 3.7 float 4.8 String “2” String “4” String “24” String “2” int 4 Error operation not defined for an operand of type String and int You must refer to your language’s documentation for how each operator functions. Operator behavior, particularly in the presence of mixed-type operands varies from language to language.\nInfix vs. Prefix The form operand1 operator operand2 is called infix notation. However, there is another construct called prefix, that looks like operator operand1 operand2 or + 2 4. For technical reasons it is easier to write programming languages that use prefix notation. In OOP, you may see prefix notations used for methods and classes which were adapted from a functional programming language where prefix notation is more common.\nUnary Operations There are some operations that have just one operand, these are called unary operations. The typical form is operator operand or operand operator. A fairly common unary operator is ! for the logical operation “not”. !True is the same as False, more on this in the chapter on Boolean Logic.\n",

Subgoals are designed to help us structure our thinking process in a way that matches what an experienced developer might have.\nA great example is learning how to read.

An experienced developer can fluently read and write code, seeing and understanding entire code structures at a glance. Novice developers often have to look at a single line at a time, and break it down into individual parts before it is apparent what the code says. That’s just part of the learning process!\nTo make this process easier, this course will include many pages that describe subgoals we can use to help analyze and write code. In essence, we can treat these subgoals as a set of steps to follow mentally when performing these tasks. Over time, we’ll become more comfortable with each task, and the subgoals will quickly become ingrained knowledge. Just like we can easily read both “cat” and “catastrophe” at a glance, with practice we’ll be able to read code just as quickly!\nMore Information For more information on Subgoals, see the work of Dr. Briana Morrison published through the ACM and elsewhere. Link\nAnalyzing Expressions To analyze an expression involving variables and mathematical operators in code, here are some mental subgoals we can use:\n1. Check Types First, we must determine whether the data type of the expression is compatible with the data type of the variable we want to store it in. In Java, we must be very careful to make sure we are only storing whole numbers in the integer data type, and floating point values in the double data type.\n2. Perform Prefix Operations Next, we should look at the expression to determine if there are any prefixed operations that must occur first. In Java, for example, we could find a prefixed increment operator like ++x, so we’ll need to update the value of x before moving to the next step.\n3. Solve Arithmetic Equation At this point, we can solve the arithmetic equation using the order of operations for our language. This simply involves the process of substituting values for variables and performing the requested operations. However, once again we must be careful to make sure that the operands provided to each operator are valid and produce the correct data type. The example we saw earlier for handling a large equation showed us a great way to work through this process.\n4. Confirm Data Type of Result \u0026 Store It Once we’ve solved the arithmetic equation, we should be left with a variable on the left side of the equals sign and a single value on the right side. So, once again, we should confirm that the value on the right can be stored in the data type of the variable on the left.\n5. Perform Postfix Operations Finally, if the original expression included any postfix operations, such as a postfixed decrement like x-- in Java, we’ll need to update the value of x before moving on to the next line.\nExamples Let’s walk through an example showing how to use these subgoals to evaluate a few expression statements.\nint x = 3 + 5; We’ll break this down by subgoals:\nWe can easily confirm that the data type of the variable is int, and that the numbers on the right side of the equation are all integers, so we shouldn’t have any issues with data types initially. This reminds us to look for prefix operations. Since there aren’t any, we can move on. We can now solve the arithmetic equation on the right side of the expression. So, we can easily find that 3 + 5 can be replaced with 8. This tells us to once again confirm that the result is a compatible value for the data type of the variable on the left. Since 8 can be stored in an int variable, we are just fine. So, we can update the value of x to 8. Finally, we must look for any postfix operations in the original equation. Since there aren’t any, we can skip this step. That’s all there is to it! While this may seem like quite a bit of information for handling a simple statement, it becomes much more useful as the statements get more complex.\nHere’s a second example:\nint x = 5; double y = 3.5; double z = ++x + -y--; Once again, let’s break the last line in this code example down by subgoals to evaluate the expression:\nThis is a bit tricky, since the statement includes several variables. However, we can look at the earlier code to see that x is an integer type, and y is a double type. Since this expression is adding them together, the result should be a floating point number, which can be stored back in the variable z with type double. So, we should be fine here. Next, we’ll see that there is a prefix expression ++x, so we’ll increment the value of x by $ 1 $ to $ 6 $. We also see a prefix operator -y, so we’ll need to remember that we are dealing with the inverse of the value stored in y. Now we can solve the equations. To do this, we’ll replace each variable with its value, then calculate the result. So, x + -y becomes 6 + -3.5 which results in 2.5. Once we have the result, we must confirm that it can be stored in the variable to the left. Since 2.5 is a floating point number, it can be stored in the double data type. So, we’ll update the value of z to $ 2.5 $. Finally, we’ll need to look for any postfix operators in the original equation. We’ll see y--, so we must decrement the value of y by $ 1 $ to $ 2.5 $ So, at the end of this short code example, we’ll see that x is $ 6 $, y is $ 2.5 $, and z is also $ 2.5 $.\nFinally, let’s look at one more example:\nint x = 5; double y = 8.5; int z = x + y; Here’s how we can break down the process of evaluating the last line in this example:\nFirst, just like the example above, we see that x is an integer and y is a double, so the sum of those values should also be a double. However, we’ll see that z is an integer. So, what will happen here? As it turns out, the Java compiler will give us an error when we try to compile this code, because we are assigning a double value to an integer which could result in the loss of data. As we can see, by carefully following these subgoals, we can even find errors in our code, just by evaluating it step by step.\n",

Check Types First, we must determine whether the data type of the expression is compatible with the data type of the variable we want to store it in.

So, we’ll update the value of z to $ 1.5 $.

    "content": "We can also use subgoals to help us write new expressions in our code. These subgoals help us understand each part of the process of building a new expression, and they also help us avoid many common errors.\nWriting Expressions Here are the subgoals for writing a new expression:\n1. Find Variable in Problem Statement The first step is to determine which part of the problem statement will be represented by a variable. Sometimes this is obvious, and other times it is not. This may be a new variable that we are creating, or it could be an update to an existing variable.\n2. Determine Name and Data Type of Variable Once we’ve found a variable to work with, we must also determine the variable’s name and data type. Once again, this may be obviously found in the problem statement, but other times we must think a bit more about what type of data will be stored in the variable. If we are working with an existing variable, we’ll need to make sure that the data type of that variable is compatible with the type of data we’d like to store in it. Of course, we should also make sure the variable has a descriptive and memorable name if we are creating a new one.\n3. Build Arithmetic Equation with Operators Now that we’ve isolated our variable, we must build an arithmetic equation and operators required to produce the desired value. This may involve using additional variables in our equations as well.\n4. Build Expression Once we have our arithmetic equation, we can then build the overall expression. This usually consists of three parts: the variable on the left, an assignment operator in the middle, and the arithmetic equation on the right.\n5. Make sure Operators and Operands are Compatible Finally, once we’ve constructed the overall expression, we should check and make sure that all operators and operands are compatible. This means making sure that we aren’t trying to assign a floating point value to an integer, or dividing two integers and expecting a floating point number as a result.\nExample Here’s a quick example to show how this process works. Consider the following problem statement:\nGiven two whole numbers, find the remainder of dividing the first number by the second number.\nLet’s use the subgoals listed above to build an expression for this problem statement\nFirst, we must identify our variables. Looking at this problem statement, we see that it expects us to be given two whole numbers. So, we’ll probably need two integer variables to represent those two numbers. Then, we’ll need a third variable to store the remainder. In total, we can easily identify three variables that we’ll need to create for this program. Next, we must determine the name and type of each of these variables. To make it very clear, I’m going to label the two input variables inputA and inputB, and the remainder variable remainder. We can also determine that each of them should be the int type, since we are only dealing with whole numbers. So, our code might begin with these three variable declarations: int inputA; int inputB; int remainder; Now we can assemble our arithmetic equation. We need to calculate the remainder of dividing inputA by inputB, so we can use the modulo operation % to find this value. So, our arithmetic equation could be inputA % inputB. Then, we can build the overall expression itself. Since we want to store the result of the arithmetic equation in remainder, we’ll build the line remainder = inputA % inputB as our entire expression. So, we can add that to our code: int inputA; int inputB; int remainder; remainder = inputA % inputB; Finally, we must make sure our operators and operands are all compatible. Since we know that both inputA and inputB are integers, the result of the modulo operation would also be an integer. So, this line is valid. Of course, the part we are missing is the values for inputA and inputB. At this point, we haven’t covered how to accept user input yet, so we can assume that those values are hard-coded into the program. So, our final program might look something like this:\nint inputA; int inputB; int remainder; inputA = 5; inputB = 8; remainder = inputA % inputB; Using these subgoals is a very great way to learn how to build programs one step at a time. As we learn more about programming and get more experience, many of these steps will become automatic. This is very similar to how we write sentences by hand. We typically don’t think about each letter as we write it once we are fluent with the language, but instead we think of entire words and our brain is able to send the correct commands to produce the desired output. With time and practice, writing code will be very similar.\n",

Consider the following problem statement:\nGiven two whole numbers as command line inputs, find the remainder of dividing the first number by the second number. The command line would be python3 Types.py 2 3.\nLet’s use the subgoals listed above to build an expression for this problem statement\nFirst, we must identify our variables. Looking at this problem statement, we see that it expects us to be given two whole numbers. So, we’ll probably need two integer variables to represent those two numbers.

We can also determine that each of them should be integers, since we are only dealing with whole numbers. So, our code might begin with these three variable declarations: inputA = args[1] inputB = args[2] remainder = 0 But args is a list of Strings so we need to convert inputs into integers. inputA = args[1] inputB = args[2] remainder = 0 intA = int(inputA) intB = int(inputB) Now we can assemble our arithmetic equation. We need to calculate the remainder of dividing inputA by inputB, so we can use the modulo operation % to find this value. So, our arithmetic equation could be intA % intB. Then, we can build the overall expression itself. Since we want to store the result of the arithmetic equation in remainder, we’ll build the line remainder = intA % intB as our entire expression. So, we can add that to our code: inputA = args[1] inputB = args[2] intA = int(inputA) intB = int(inputB) remainder = intA % intB Finally, we must make sure our operators and operands are all compatible.

But I could modify it to \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\" --incognito, and chrome would launch in incognito mode. The --incognito is a command line argument.\nIn this class, the command line we use typically consists of a launching program (the command) and the name of the program to run. It can also have data which can be passed to the program.\n$ \u003ccommand\u003e \u003cprogram\u003e \u003cargument1\u003e \u003cargument2\u003e ... $ java Add 2 5 7 $ python3 Add.py 2 5 7 In both cases the program Add would run, and would be passed the strings: “2” and “5”. How this is coded will be covered in a few chapters, for now you just need to know how to pass arguments into you program.\nCommon Properties of Command Line Arguments There are some common properties of command line arguments you need to know.\nArguments are passed in as strings. Programmers must convert them to the appropriate data types. Arguments are passed in order from left to right. If your problem specification asks for a positive number then a negative number, you must provide them in that order. java Program 2 -7 would be correct, java Program -7 2 would be wrong. Arguments are separated by one or more spaces. There are ways for a program to tell how many arguments there are. That’s pretty much it. User input can be provided on the command line in the form of string arguments (values). When the command is run, these arguments are packed up by the operating system and given to the program. When command line arguments are required (or optional), the problem statement will tell you their order and purpose. The decision on whether or not to use command line arguments is typically a design consideration.\nStreams Both file and keyboard input are handled as streams. Streams are a computer science abstraction for data that is organized in a queue. Data (usually bytes) are ordered and read from front to back. You can see how this works for the keyboard. When we type “dog” the keyboard stream (called stdin for “standard input”) receives the bytes [100, 111, 103]. Files from a disk drive are similarly read first byte to last.\nStreams as Objects Object oriented high level programming like Java and Python have built in classes that read values from a stream. Thus, with some minor set up differences, the commands to read from a file are typically exactly same the commands to read from the keyboard. This is the power of abstraction – the details of how to read from these different streams are hidden from the programmer who only wants read them.\nStreams are literally bytes of data. We will use methods that interpret those byes as text, and then convert the text to the type of variable we need.\n",

Computer programs and code are especially easy targets for plagiarism due to how easy it is to copy and manipulate code in such a way that it is unrecognizable as the original source but still performs correctly.\nAt its core, plagiarism is taking someone else’s work and passing it off as your own without giving appropriate credit to the original source. As a student at K-State, you are bound by the K-State Honor Code not to accept any unauthorized aid, and this includes plagiarized code.\nWhen it comes to plagiarism in computer code, there is a fine line between using resources appropriately and copying code. In this program, you should strive to avoid plagiarism issues by doing the following:\nDo not search for or use any complete solutions to projects in this course found online or from fellow students. Small portions of code may be used or adapted from an online source with proper citation. To cite a piece of code, include a code comment section above it that contains the original source URL and a description of why it was used. In general, copying or adapting small pieces of code to perform auxiliary functions in the assignment is permitted. Copying or adapting code that is the general goal of the assignment should be avoided. For example, if the assignment is to create a bubble sort algorithm, you should write the algorithm from scratch yourself since that is the goal of the assignment. If the assignment is to create a program for displaying data that you feel should be sorted, you may choose to adapt an existing sorting algorithm for your needs (or use one from a library).\nIf you aren’t sure about whether it is OK to use an online resource or piece of code in this course, please contact the instructors using the course discussion forums or help email address. You will not get in trouble for asking, and it will help you determine what the best course of action is. Plagiarism can really only occur when you submit the assignment for grading, so you are welcome to ask for clarification or a judgement on whether a particular usage is acceptable at any time before you submit the assignment.\nCodio has features that will compare your submissions against those of your fellow students. Any submissions with a high degree of similarity may be subjected to additional scrutiny by the instructors to determine if plagiarism has occurred.\nIn this course, any violation of the K-State Honor Code will result in a 0 on that assignment and a report made to the K-State Honor Council. A second violation will result in an XF in this course, as well as any additional sanctions imposed by the K-State Honor Council.\nFor more information on the K-State Honor \u0026 Integrity system, please visit their website, which is linked in the resources section below this video.\n",

There are a few ways to accomplish this.\nFirst, we can use System.out.print() to print text without a newline character at the end, so that the next output will begin on the same line. So, we could use that to print text and variables on the same line. Here’s an example:\nint x = 1; int y = 2; System.out.print(\"Variable x: \"); System.out.print(x); System.out.print(\", Variable y: \"); System.out.println(y); will produce this output:\nVariable x: 1, Variable y: 2 In Java, we can also concatenate multiple outputs together using the + symbol. So, we could produce similar output using this example:\nint x = 1; int y = 2; System.out.println(\"Variable x: \" + x + \" , Variable y: \" + y); which should output:\nVariable x: 1 , Variable y: 2 Notice that we needed to include an extra space after 1 in the output. This is because Java does not add a space between strings when concatenating them, so we must be careful to add the spaces ourselves where needed.\nThere are many ways that we can use Java to output text and variables as desired.

There are a few ways to accomplish this.\nFirst, we can use print(\"text\", end=\"\") to print text without a newline character at the end, so that the next output will begin on the same line. So, we could use that to print text and variables on the same line. Here’s an example:\nx = 1 y = 2 print(\"Variable x: \", end=\"\") print(x, end=\"\") print(\", Variable y: \", end=\"\") print(y) will produce this output:\nVariable x: 1, Variable y: 2 In Python, we can also provide multiple arguments to the print() method, and it will print each one in order, separated by a space. So, we could produce similar output using this example:\nx = 1 y = 2 print(\"Variable x:\", x, \", Variable y: \", y) which should output:\nVariable x: 1 , Variable y: 2 Notice that there is an extra space after 1 in the output. This is because Python automatically adds a space between each argument provided to the print() method. So, we must be careful about our formatting using this method.\nWe can also use the format() method in Python to include many variables in a single piece of text. We’ll cover more about the format() method in a later chapter, but here’s an example of how it could be used to create the desired output:\nx = 1 y = 2 print(\"Variable x: {}, Variable y: {}\".format(x, y)) Inside of the text, we use curly brackets {} to denote where to place the variables. Then, we place a .format directly after the text, and inside of that method call we provide the variables we’d like to include in the text. The variables are included in the respective order they are given, so, in this example, x will be placed where the first curly braces {} are, and y will be placed where the second curly braces are.\nWhen we run this program, it will output:\nVariable x: 1, Variable y: 2 Other languages allow us to use the plus + operator to concatenate, or join, two pieces of text together. Python also includes this feature, but it is much more restrictive. Let’s look at an example:\nx = 1 y = 2 print(\"Variable x: \" + x + \", Variable y: \" + y) When we try to run this program, we will get the following error:\nThat seems strange, doesn’t it? It turns out that the Python interpreter tries its best to interpret whether the plus symbol should be used for addition and concatenation. Since the first operand is text, it assumes we’d like to do concatenation. However, the second operand is x, which is an int variable. Python does not automatically convert numerical variables to text (denoted as type str, short for String), and it doesn’t know how to concatenate text and a number together. So, it gives us an error.\nTo resolve this problem, we must convert our numerical variables to text, using the str() method to cast those variables to the str data type. So, we must modify the example above to resemble this one:\nx = 1 y = 2 print(\"Variable x: \" + str(x) + \", Variable y: \" + str(y)) which will now output:\nVariable x: 1, Variable y: 2 There are many ways that we can use Python to output text and variables as desired. We’ll use some of these methods to complete this project.\n",

While the program may only consist of a few lines of code at most, it is still a very big step toward writing bigger and more advanced programs.\nComputer technology has some quite a long way since the 1950s, but the same needs that drove the development of compilers and interpreters continue today to drive the development of more advanced programming languages and related tools. It’s a very exciting field to experience firsthand, and once we understand a bit of code, we’ll be able to see it for ourselves.\nIn the next chapter, we’ll dive in head first to learn all about how to store and manipulate various types of data in our programs.\nNow that we are done with this unit, we can mark it as completed.
