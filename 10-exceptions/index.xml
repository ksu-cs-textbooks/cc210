      <description>A good computer program should always run properly and produce the desired output. That is the whole point of writing code such that a computer can follow those instructions perfectly, with unerring accuracy and unrivaled speed.&#xA;However, the real world, and the people that occupy it, is anything but perfect. Computers can crash, users can provide faulty input, and even the best programmers can create code that doesn’t work exactly as intended.</description>

      <title>What is an Exception?</title>

      <description>An exception is an error caused by some problem in a computer program. It could be due to invalid input from the user, an issue with the system that the code is running on, or even a bug or unintended situation written into the code itself.&#xA;For example, we know from mathematics that we cannot divide a number by $ 0 $. Specifically, the result of dividing any number by zero is undefined, so we have no way of expressing that value.</description>

      <title>Exception vs. Error</title>

      <description>Problems in a computer program can typically be divided into two categories: exceptions and errors. While these terms are used interchangeably by many programmers, there is a specific difference between these two types of problems. In this course, we’ll try to stick to the following convention:&#xA;Exception: An exception is a problem encountered by a running computer program (we could also say “at runtime”) which can be handled, or detected and corrected, by the program itself.</description>

      <title>Handling Exceptions</title>

      <description>YouTube Video Video Materials&#xA;Now that we’ve learned a bit about what exceptions are, let’s take a look at an example to see how we might encounter exceptions in our programs and how we can possibly handle them.&#xA;Consider the following program:&#xA;In this program, we first get the name of a file to open from the user. Then, we open that file and create a reader to allow us to read data from the file.</description>

      <title>Creating Exceptions</title>

      <description>We can also create our own exceptions to handle specific situations in our own programs. Consider the following program flowchart:&#xA;In this program, we first accept input from the user. Then, if that input is less than $0$, we create an exception (as indicated by the triangle containing Err in the flowchart). If the input is greater than or equal to 0, we’ll just output it.&#xA;Of course, creating an exception in this way is probably not the best way to go about this.</description>

      <description>Learning how to write programs that properly catch and handle exceptions is a part of becoming a good programmer. If we can build programs that can handle many common errors, our programs will be much easier to use and won’t crash nearly as often.&#xA;In this chapter, we learned about the methods for dealing with exceptions in our programs. In addition, we saw several examples of common exceptions that we may encounter.</description>
