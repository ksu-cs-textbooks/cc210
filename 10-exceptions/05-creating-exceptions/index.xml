    <title>Creating Exceptions :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/10-exceptions/05-creating-exceptions/</link>
    <description>We can also create our own exceptions to handle specific situations in our own programs. Consider the following program flowchart:&#xA;In this program, we first accept input from the user. Then, if that input is less than $0$, we create an exception (as indicated by the triangle containing Err in the flowchart). If the input is greater than or equal to 0, weâ€™ll just output it.&#xA;Of course, creating an exception in this way is probably not the best way to go about this.</description>
