<h1 id="exception-vs-error">Exception vs. Error</h1>

<p>Problems in a computer program can typically be divided into two categories: <em>exceptions</em> and <em>errors</em>. While these terms are used interchangeably by many programmers, there is a specific difference between these two types of problems. In this course, we&rsquo;ll try to stick to the following convention:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exception</strong>: An exception is a problem encountered by a running computer program (we could also say &ldquo;at runtime&rdquo;) which can be <em>handled</em>, or detected and corrected, by the program itself. This may include asking the user to provide new input, manipulating data, or retrying an operation that failed.</li>
<li><strong>Error</strong>: An error is a problem which <em>cannot</em> be solved by the program itself, and usually results in the program&rsquo;s termination. This could include syntax errors and unexpected system issues, such as a lack of memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see many examples of both exceptions and errors later in this chapter.</p>
