    <title>Exception vs. Error :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/10-exceptions/03-exception-vs-error/</link>
    <description>Problems in a computer program can typically be divided into two categories: exceptions and errors. While these terms are used interchangeably by many programmers, there is a specific difference between these two types of problems. In this course, we’ll try to stick to the following convention:&#xA;Exception: An exception is a problem encountered by a running computer program (we could also say “at runtime”) which can be handled, or detected and corrected, by the program itself.</description>
