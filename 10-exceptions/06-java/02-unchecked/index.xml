    <title>Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/10-exceptions/06-java/02-unchecked/</link>
    <description>Beyond the difference between exceptions and errors we’ve already discussed, Java also makes a distinction between two types of exceptions, checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. Let’s look more closely at each of these groups below.&#xA;Checked Exceptions A checked exception is detected by the Java compiler. When it detects a checked exception, the compiler then looks to see if the exception will be detected and handled within the code. If not, it will then check to see if the method containing that code includes a throws clause1 at the end of the method declaration that includes this particular exception.</description>
