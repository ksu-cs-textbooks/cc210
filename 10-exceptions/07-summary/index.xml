    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/10-exceptions/07-summary/</link>
    <description>Learning how to write programs that properly catch and handle exceptions is a part of becoming a good programmer. If we can build programs that can handle many common errors, our programs will be much easier to use and wonâ€™t crash nearly as often.&#xA;In this chapter, we learned about the methods for dealing with exceptions in our programs. In addition, we saw several examples of common exceptions that we may encounter.</description>
