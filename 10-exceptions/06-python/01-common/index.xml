    <title>Common Exceptions :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/10-exceptions/06-python/01-common/</link>
    <description>Before we learn about how to detect and handle exceptions in Python, let’s review some of the common exceptions and errors we may see in our programs. Each of the headers below is the name of an exception in Python, which is represented by a particular class in the Python programming language.&#xA;Exception Every exception that can be handled in Python is a subtype of the Exception class. So, when we aren’t sure which type of exception to expect, we can always use the Exception class to make sure we catch all of them.</description>
