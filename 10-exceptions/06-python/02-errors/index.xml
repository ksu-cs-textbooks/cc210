    <title>Exceptions vs. Errors :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/10-exceptions/06-python/02-errors/</link>
    <description>Since Python is an interpreted language, it can be hard to tell the difference between exceptions and errors. So, letâ€™s take a minute to review those two terms and what they mean.&#xA;Exceptions An exception is any issue encountered while executing a program that can be resolved within the program itself. Typically most exceptions come from incorrect user input, but they can be caused by other issues as well. However, just because an exception can be resolved by the program does not automatically mean that the program does, or must, include a handler for that exception.</description>
