    <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script Letâ€™s take a closer look at how we can use a Try-Except statement in Python to detect and handle exceptions that are caused by our program. Specifically want to take a program that looks like this, and update it to look more like this, with code to catch and handle exceptions that are thrown by the program.&#xA;To do this, we can start with a simple program.</description>
