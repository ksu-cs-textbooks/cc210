<h1 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h1>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve seen lots of information about how to throw, catch, and handle exceptions in Python, it is a great time to discuss some of the best practices we can apply in our code to make it as readable and bulletproof as possible. While these aren&rsquo;t strict rules that must be followed all the time, they are great things to keep in mind as we write code that deals with exceptions.</p>
<h2 id="leave-no-exception-unhandled">Leave No Exception Unhandled</h2>
<p>As much as possible, we should write our code to handle any exception we can reasonably expect our users to run into when using our programs. We cannot assume that users will always provide the correct input in the correct format, and a single typo by a user should not cause our entire program to crash.</p>
<p>Instead, we should always use <strong>Try-Except</strong> statements whenever possible to detect and handle those errors as simply as possible. In addition, if the program is interactive, we can combine that approach with the use of loops to prompt the user to provide new input to resolve the error.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Don&rsquo;t Substitute Unchecked Exception Handling for Value Checking</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>You can go &ldquo;try except&rdquo; crazy.  Exception handling is powerful, but also slow, really really slow.</p>
<p>You can write something like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code>try:
    ratio = x / y
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(&#34;Cannot divide by zero&#34;)</code></pre></div><p>but</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code>if y !=0:
    ratio = x / y;
else:
    print(&#34;Cannot divide by zero&#34;)</code></pre></div><p>executes a lot more efficiently.</p>
<p>Many exceptions can be avoided through value checking.  In this course, we may direct you to throw and catch exceptions of this type for practice in exception coding.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="external" target="_blank">Python Documentation</a> is an okay resource to determine which exceptions could be thrown by any methods used in our code.  However Python does not provide a standard or comprehensive list of the Exceptions and conditions which cause them for all methods in all modules&ndash;nor is their enumeration in the Python Docs in a standard place or format.</p>

It makes analysis of the program very difficult.</p>
<h2 id="be-specific">Be Specific</h2>
<p>We should also always strive to use specific exceptions in our <code>except</code> statements whenever we can. So, if we are opening a file, we should include an <code>except</code> statement for a FileNotFoundError, and not just a single generic <code>Exception</code>. Even though this means we may have to include several <code>except</code> statements, it is much better in the long run because it allows us to know exactly what happened when our code has a problem.</p>
<p>In addition, we should always make sure we catch the most specific exceptions first, before any more generic exceptions. As we saw earlier, if we try to catch an OSError before a FileNotFoundError, we won&rsquo;t be able to tell when we&rsquo;ve reached a FileNotFoundError at all, since it is a subtype of the OSError.</p>
<h2 id="use-messages-and-stack-traces">Use Messages and Stack Traces</h2>
<p>The Python Exception class includes some very helpful methods we can use to get additional information when we encounter an exception.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example to show what we can learn:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>

<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s">$</span><span class="nb"> python</span><span class="m">3</span><span class="nb"> </span><span class="m">8</span><span class="nb">p</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nb">except</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nb">StackTrace.py
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">Error</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="nb"> Trying to Divide by Zero</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="nb">

</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">ZeroDivisionError: division by zero</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>On the first line, we are printing our own error message. Below that, we are using <code>traceback.print_exc(file=sys.stdout)</code> to print a full stack trace showing the location of the error in code. In this example, we included <code>file=sys.stdout</code> because the method will print to <code>sys.stderr</code> by default, a different output stream. This just makes it easier to see all of our output on the terminal for now.</p>
<p>In general, it is best to only show a short error message to users, but in some cases it may be better to add our own message. The text &ldquo;division by zero&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t very clear, even to developers. Instead, we could say &ldquo;Error: divisor cannot be zero&rdquo; to make the error message clearer.</p>
<p>The information contained in the stack trace is very helpful to developers when trying to debug and fix problems in the code, but that information is very confusing to users. As we learn how to build more advanced programs, we&rsquo;ll see how to record and log those error messages and stack traces for debugging, but hide them from our users.</p>
<p>To see what other methods are available, refer to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Traceback</a> library in the Python documentation.</p>
<h2 id="dont-ignore-exceptions">Don&rsquo;t Ignore Exceptions</h2>
<p>Another big problem is that many developers tend to catch exceptions, only to ignore them so their program doesn&rsquo;t crash. Here&rsquo;s a quick example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">reader</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stdin</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">reader</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readline</span><span class="p">())</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">Exception</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="k">pass</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="c1"># do nothing</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this code, if the user inputs something that can&rsquo;t be converted to an integer, the code just silently ignores the exception and proceeds with <code>x</code> still storing the value $0$. While that may not cause issues, it can also make it very frustrating to debug later issues or changes in this program. So, it is always best to output an error message when an exception occurs, even if it can be easily ignored without additional input from the user. This will make it easier to debug additional issues later on in development.</p>
<h2 id="bulletproof-code">Bulletproof Code</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple program that asks the user for input, and will repeat the question until a valid input is received. This code is designed to handle many common situations and exceptions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>

<ol>
<li>First, the program uses a <strong>Try-Except</strong> statement containing a <strong>With</strong> statement to make sure that the file will be properly closed when we are done with it. As we&rsquo;ve discussed, this is a good practice when handling input via files, but really any input object can be handled in this way.</li>
<li>The outer <strong>Try-Except</strong> statement has a two <code>except</code> blocks.  The first handles not finding the file (the most likely exception).  The second captures anything else that might go wrong with the reader .</li>
<li>Inside of the <strong>While</strong> loop, there is a second <strong>Try-Except</strong> statement to handle errors that come from reading an individual input, such as a ValueError.</li>
<li>In addition, that inner <strong>Try-Except</strong> statement will also catch any generic Exceptions that might occur when reading input. In that case, we use the <code>sys.exit()</code> method to stop executing the program, since it may be difficult to continue to read input in that case. Thankfully, since we are using a <strong>With</strong> block, the reader will be correctly closed for us automatically. In addition, any <code>finally</code> blocks would be executed before the program stops.</li>
</ol>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Don&rsquo;t Exit Early!</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>We have not discussed the <code>sys.exit()</code> method yet, but you may have come across it while reading code online. In Python, the <code>sys.exit()</code> method is used to exit the Python interpreter safely from within a program</p>
<p>For now, if we find that we need to exit our program when handling an error, we can safely use the <code>sys.exit()</code> method as shown in the example above. It will make sure that any <code>finally</code> blocks and <strong>With</strong> statements are executed properly.</p>
<p>There are some other ways to exit the Python interpreter that you can find online, but they may do so without properly closing any resources or executing <code>finally</code> blocks. They can also make your code much more difficult to maintain and test. This can be very dangerous!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Of course, there are many things that can be done differently in this code, depending on our preferences and how we&rsquo;d like our program to function. This is just one possible way to build useful code that handles several exceptions.</p>
