    <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script In this module, we’ll learn how we can model real-world items in our code through the use of classes. It is one of the core features of any object-oriented programming language, but it can sometimes be difficult to understand at first how this works. So, let’s walk through a quick example to see how we can represent items from the world in our classes, and what features those classes might have.</description>
