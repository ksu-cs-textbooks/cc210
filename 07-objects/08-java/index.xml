      <description>Now that we understand the basics of what classes and objects are in object-oriented programming, let&amp;rsquo;s look at how to create these items in Java.
Creating an Instance Class Creating a class in Java is very similar to creating a method. The syntax is &amp;lt;access modifier&amp;gt; class &amp;lt;ClassName&amp;gt; {&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;}. We will use public for all our class-access modifiers. The class definition (body), like all Java code-bodies, is enclosed in {}.</description>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/07-objects/08-java/02-initialization/index.html</guid>
      <description>Of course, our classes are not very useful at this point because they don&amp;rsquo;t include any attributes or methods. Including instance attributes in an object class is one of the their basic uses, so let&amp;rsquo;s start there.
Types of Attributes There are two types of attributes: Class and Instance.
Instance attributes are variables that &amp;ldquo;belong&amp;rdquo; to the instance. It makes sense that a Student object owns its own name.
We will defer discussion of class attributes to a later module.</description>

      <title>Instances &amp; Testing</title>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/07-objects/08-java/03-instances-testing/index.html</guid>
      <description>Your class should now look something like this, although your default values may be different:
public class Ingredient{ public String name; public double amount; public String units; public Ingredient(){ this.name = &amp;#34;flour&amp;#34;; this.amount = 2.0; this.units = &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34;; } }As classes grow large you will want to test methods as you add them. In CC 410 we will learn about test frameworks and will write formal tests in parallel with project development.</description>

      <title>Instance Methods</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/07-objects/08-java/04-instance-methods/index.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/07-objects/08-java/04-instance-methods/index.html</guid>
      <description>We can also add additional methods to our classes. These methods are used either to modify the attributes of the class or to perform actions based on the attributes stored in the class. Finally, we can even use those methods to perform actions on data provided as arguments. In essence, the sky is the limit with methods in classes, so we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to do just about anything we need to do in these methods.</description>

      <title>Driver Class</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/07-objects/08-java/05-driver-class/index.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/07-objects/08-java/05-driver-class/index.html</guid>
      <description>The Driver class is much simpler. It has one feature, a class method public static void main(String[] args)1. Everything that needs to be done will be done in the main method. A template might be:
public class Driver{ public static void main(String[] args){ } } Class vs. Static Features A class feature belongs to the class, no object is necessary to use it. Examples include math methods we write
double five = Math.</description>

      <title>A Worked Example</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/07-objects/08-java/06-example/index.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/07-objects/08-java/06-example/index.html</guid>
      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s put this all together by finishing our project with a full worked example. We want to use our Ingredient class to help us bake some sugar cookies. Unfortunately, the recipe uses both cups and milliliters interchangeably, and we want to be able to scale the recipe up or down depending on how many batches we need to make.
So, let&amp;rsquo;s build a program that performs that task for us. It should first ask the user to choose a desired unit of measurement by selecting a number, with 1 representing &amp;ldquo;cups&amp;rdquo; and 2 representing &amp;ldquo;ml&amp;rdquo;.</description>
