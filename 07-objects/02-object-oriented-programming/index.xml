    <title>Object-Oriented Programming :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/07-objects/02-object-oriented-programming/</link>
    <description>Data Centric At its heart, object-oriented programming is about the data. We may talk about how a class stands for a blueprint or outline of a real world item, but what we mean is the data that describes and defines that real world object. It is how we choose to model this data, how we allow access to it and manipulate it, that drives the object-oriented paradigm.&#xA;There are four pillars to object-oriented programming, all having to do with data and how it can be accessed and changed.</description>
