    <description>A class can serve many functions, the most basic of which is to serve as a blueprint for the data and methods used to access and manipulate that data. We will refer to these as “object” or “instance” classes. An object class is a class with the primary purpose of encapsulating and manipulating related data.&#xA;When you instantiate an object of a class, you create a variable of that type. The class definition is only a only the specification for each of those items.</description>
