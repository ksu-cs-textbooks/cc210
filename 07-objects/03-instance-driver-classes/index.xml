    <title>Instance &amp; Driver Classes :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/07-objects/03-instance-driver-classes/</link>
    <description>Thus far in this course we have always had just one class, and in most cases one method. So, while we have been following some object-oriented conventions like starting in main(), our designs have not followed an object-oriented programming paradigm. This was deliberate, as the first few modules are necessary to cover the basics of program control.&#xA;We will begin bending our designs toward object-oriented programming with this module by introducing instance and driver classes.</description>
