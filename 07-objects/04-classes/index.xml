    <description>The first step in creating a program that can represent things in the real world is to determine which things weâ€™d like to include in our program, and then create classes that can describe the different types of objects.&#xA;Class In programming, a class describes an individual entity or part of the program. In many cases, the class can be used to describe an actual thing, such as a person, a vehicle, or a game board, or a more abstract thing such as a set of rules for a game, or even an artificial intelligence engine for making business decisions.</description>
