    <description>Instance class are not normally executable. That is they may contain lots of fields (attributes) and methods, but generally have no main() method. The technique we will use for the next few modules will be to have a companion driver class.&#xA;In the UML class diagram above you will see we added a separate class Driver, which has one method and no attributes.&#xA;The first thing you may notice is that the method is underlined.</description>
