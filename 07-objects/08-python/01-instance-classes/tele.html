<h1 id="instance-classes">Instance Classes</h1>

<p>Now that we understand the basics of what classes and objects are in object-oriented programming, let&rsquo;s look at how to create these items in Python.</p>
<h2 id="creating-an-instance-class">Creating an Instance Class</h2>
<p>Creating a class in Python is very similar to creating a function. We can simply use the <code>class</code> keyword, followed by an identifier for the class and a colon.  The class definition, like all Python definitions and code-bodies, is indented.</p>
<p>While it is not required, it is recommended to place just a single class in each file, with the filename matching the name of the class, followed by the <code>.py</code> file extension. By convention, class names in Python are written in PascalCase, meaning that each word is capitalized and there are no spaces between the words. We&rsquo;ll follow these rules in our code.</p>
<p>So, to create an empty class named <code>Ingredient</code>, we would place the following code in a file named <code>Ingredient.py</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Ingredient</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="k">pass</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we&rsquo;ve already learned, each class declaration in Python includes these parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>class</code> - this keyword says that we are declaring a new class.</li>
<li><code>Ingredient</code> - this is an identifier that gives us the name of the class we are declaring.</li>
<li>a colon (<code>:</code>) following the the identifier</li>
<li>a body (indented)&ndash; For the moment we&rsquo;ll use <code>pass</code></li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of the declaration, we see a colon <code>:</code> marking the start of a new block, inside of which will be all of the <em>attributes</em> and <em>methods</em> stored in this class. We&rsquo;ll need to indent all items inside of this class, just like we do with other blocks in Python.</p>
<p>In order for Python to allow this code to run, we cannot have an empty block inside of a class declaration. So, we can add the keyword <code>pass</code> to the block inside of the class so that it is not empty. <code>pass</code>  tells the compiler to do nothing.  It is also referred to as a &ldquo;no-op&rdquo;, which has its roots in assembly, a very low level language.  High level languages typically use a no-op when their syntax rules require that a code-block exists, but the program requires that code block do nothing.</p>
<p>To the left, we should see a tab for <code>Ingredient.py</code>. Let&rsquo;s go ahead and add the class declaration to it. Once we&rsquo;ve completed that, we can use the button below to check our code and confirm that it is working before moving ahead.</p>
