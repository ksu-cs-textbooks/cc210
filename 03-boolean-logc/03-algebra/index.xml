      <description>Resources Slides Video Script One of the biggest missing things in the original version of Boolean logic is how to handle the application of the Not operator to a larger statement. The solution to that problem was added by Augustus De Morgan, who was using George Boole&amp;rsquo;s new format for formal logic to express rules already present in older forms of logic.
Specifically, these rules deal with how to handle a situation such as this, where the NOT operator has been applied to a larger expression in Boolean algebra.</description>
