<p>One of the biggest missing things in the original version of Boolean logic is how to handle the application of the Not operator to a larger statement. The solution to that problem was added by Augustus De Morgan, who was using George Boole&rsquo;s new format for formal logic to express rules already present in older forms of logic.</p>
<p>Specifically, these rules deal with how to handle a situation such as this, where the NOT operator has been applied to a larger expression in Boolean algebra. How can we handle this?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the truth table and see if we can figure it out. So, we know from earlier that the truth table for A AND B looks like this. So, if we want to find the truth table for NOT A AND B, we&rsquo;d just invert those values. Notice that this column on the right includes three True values and one False value. That gives us a clue about how to solve this. Can you remember which other Boolean operator results in three True values and one False value?</p>
<p>That would be the OR operation. If we look closely, we notice that the rightmost column is true if either A or B are false, or if both of them are false. So, we can guess that NOT A AND B is roughly the same as NOT A OR NOT B</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what De Morgan&rsquo;s law is about. According to De Morgan&rsquo;s Laws, the inverse of A AND B is NOT A OR NOT B. In fact, the same process works for the inverse of A OR B as well.</p>
<p>So, in summary, De Morgan&rsquo;s law states that whenever we want to find the inverse of a Boolean logic expression, we first distribute the not symbol to all parts inside of the expression, then we invert the ANDS and ORS. That&rsquo;s all there is to it!</p>
<p>Being able to understand these complex Boolean logic expressions is a really handy skill in computer programming. Make sure you take a minute to fully understand these rules!</p>
