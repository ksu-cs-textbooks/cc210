    <description>First, let’s explore the simplest of these collections, the list. A list is defined as an ordered collection or sequence of elements, meaning that the order in which the elements were added to the list is preserved, but that order can be updated through the use of sorting algorithms.&#xA;We’ve already worked with lists in this course, but in previous modules we included one important restriction: we would know the maximum size of the list ahead of time.</description>
