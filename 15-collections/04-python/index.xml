      <description>Python includes an extensive library of classes that can be included in any Python program. These classes are included as part of the Python Standard Library, which is included in most installations of the Python programming language.&#xA;Thankfully, the developers of the Python programming language have also written an extensive online manual that explains all of the features of the Python Standard Library in detail. Many developers refer to this manual as the Python API, or sometimes simply the documentation for the Python Standard Library.</description>

      <description>The Python Standard Library, as well as the Python programming language itself, contains several different classes specifically designed to store data. All together, they are generically referred to as collections since they are used to store a “collection” of data.&#xA;Python contains implementations for several different data structures, which are classes used to store and manipulate data in specific ways. We’ll learn more about how each of these implementations works and differs in a later course, but in this course, we’ll quickly describe a few of the most common ones.</description>

      <title>Classes Contain Methods</title>

      <description>Sometimes we just want a collection of associated methods – think math.pi. In Python we could accomplish this by having a class that has no class or instance attributes and only static methods. Raymond Hettinger, a Python Language developer goes so far as to say the purpose of @staticmethod is to attach methods to classes1&#xA;So in Python a “bucket” of&#xA;class my_math: @staticmethod def pi(): return 3.1416 @staticmethod def circle_area(radius): return radius * radius * my_math.</description>

      <title>List</title>

      <description>First, let’s explore the simplest of these collections, the list. A list is defined as an ordered collection or sequence of elements, meaning that the order in which the elements were added to the list is preserved, but that order can be updated through the use of sorting algorithms.&#xA;We’ve already worked with lists in this course, but in previous modules we included one important restriction: we would know the maximum size of the list ahead of time.</description>

      <title>Dictionaries</title>

      <description>Next, let’s explore another important collection, the dictionary. Some programming languages, such as Java, refer to this collection as a map as well.&#xA;A map is a collection that associates, or maps, a key to a value. To store something in a dictionary, we must provide a unique key for each value. If we provide a key that is already in use, the value stored by that key is overwritten. Then, to retrieve a value, we simply provide the key that is associated with that value.</description>

      <description>The last data structure we will explore is the tuple. A tuple in mathematics is defined as a “finite ordered list” of items. So, it is a list of items that is not infinite, and the ordering of the items in that list matters.&#xA;Thankfully, Python includes support for immutable tuples directly in the language, so we can use them in our programs quickly and easily.&#xA;Tuples are generally used when:</description>

      <description>As we continue to write larger and more complex programs, it is important to remember that we can include comments and documentation in our code. Comments are lines of text in our program’s source code that are ignored by the compiler or interpreter, allowing us to add information to the program beyond the code itself.&#xA;These help explain our code to anyone who might read it, but can even be useful to help us remember exactly how it works or what it does, especially if we end up coming back to a program written a long time ago that we do not remember very well.</description>
