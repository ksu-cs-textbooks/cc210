    <description>First, letâ€™s explore the simplest of these collections, the list. A list is defined as an ordered collection or sequence of elements, meaning that the order in which the elements were added to the list is preserved, but that order can be updated through the use of sorting algorithms.&#xA;Lists are similar to arrays in many ways. The biggest difference in Java is that arrays must be declared with a static size that cannot be changed, whereas a list can hold any number of elements, even without knowing the number of elements it will contain ahead of time.</description>
