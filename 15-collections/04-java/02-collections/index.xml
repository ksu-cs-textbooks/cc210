    <description>The Java API contains several different classes specifically designed to store data. All together, we usually refer to these classes as the collections framework since they are used to store a “collection” of data.&#xA;The Java collections framework contains implementations for several different data structures, which are classes used to store and manipulate data in specific ways. We’ll learn more about how each of these implementations works and differs in a later course, but in this course, we’ll quickly describe a few of the most common ones.</description>
