    <title>Java Maps :: CC 210 Textbook</title>

    <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script The next collection weâ€™ll review is the map, also known as the dictionary. A map is a collection that associates a key with a value. However, instead of arrays associating an array index with a value, a map can use any data type as the key as well as the value. Because of this, maps are easily searchable by key, and are typically used to store and retrieve data quickly in a program.</description>
