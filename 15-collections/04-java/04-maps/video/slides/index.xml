    <description>Maps (Dictionaries) Associate key with value Key &amp; value can be any data type Easily searchable by key Store and retrieve data quickly The program will store a map that associates lines of input with random integers. When a line of input is read, the program will check to see if that line has already been used as a key in the map. If so, it will return the value associated with that key.</description>
