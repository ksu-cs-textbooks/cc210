    <description>Next, letâ€™s explore another important collection, the map. Some programming languages, such as Python, refer to this collection as a dictionary as well.&#xA;A map is a collection that associates, or maps, a key to a value. To store something in a map, we must provide a unique key for each value. If we provide a key that is already in use, the value stored by that key is overwritten. Then, to retrieve a value, we simply provide the key that is associated with that value.</description>
