Strings: we’ve already learned about how to use and manipulate strings in our programs. Most of those methods and classes for dealing with strings come directly from the language’s library File I/0: similarly, opening, reading, and writing to files is also included in the library for most languages Lists: a more flexible and general form of an array, a list is a data structure that can expand to hold many items.">

<h1 id="common-features">Common Features</h1>

<p>Each programming language chooses many different features to include in the library for that language. Thankfully, there are a few common features that most languages seem to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strings: we&rsquo;ve already learned about how to use and manipulate strings in our programs. Most of those methods and classes for dealing with strings come directly from the language&rsquo;s library</li>
<li>File I/0: similarly, opening, reading, and writing to files is also included in the library for most languages</li>
<li>Lists: a more flexible and general form of an array, a list is a data structure that can expand to hold many items. In addition, most implementations of a list include several helpful methods for sorting, searching, and manipulating the list in many different ways.</li>
<li>Maps: in programming, a <strong>map</strong>, sometimes called a <strong>dictionary</strong>, is a data structure that associates a <strong>key</strong> with a <strong>value</strong>. For example, an object representing a student could be stored in a map, using the student&rsquo;s unique student ID as the key. This allows us to quickly search for and find a value based on its associated key.</li>
<li>Tuples: a <strong>tuple</strong> is a special data type that associates multiple values into a single variable. It is very similar to a class that only contains attributes, getters. Some languages, such as Python, include this directly as a feature of the language, while other languages, such as Java, require a bit of work to use tuples directly.  Tuples are typically implemented as immutable data types, values are set at instantiation and may not change.</li>
<li>Network I/O: most programming languages also include features to communicate via a network or the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this is just a short list of the items that might be included in each programming language&rsquo;s library. In this module, we&rsquo;ll explore several of these in the language we are learning.</p>
