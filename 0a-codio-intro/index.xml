      <description>Welcome to Codio! For this class, we’ll be using Codio for most of our work. You will access Codio via the links provided in your class materials.&#xA;Each module will contain Codio tutorials, Codio projects and occasionally a quiz or discussion.&#xA;Click the Next button below, or the Right Arrow at the top of this page, to continue to the next guide page in this Codio project.</description>

      <description>Each module in Canvas will usually contain two Codio tutorial assignments. Some weeks may have more; in any event module content must be accomplished in order.&#xA;The first tutorial is a programming language agnostic discussion of the concept the module introduces. Often this tutorial introduces pseudo code, has questions and may contain a Parsons Puzzle. Most of the questions only allow one attempt, however Parsons Puzzles will allow multiple tries. The second tutorial will contain your language specific implementation of this concept; the syntax (format) and semantics (behavior/meaning) of the specific keywords.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video On some pages, the Codio guide may also switch to a different view, shown here, allowing you to work directly with code. On the far left is the file tree, which shows all of the files accessible to you for this tutorial. Then, in the middle, you may also see one or more open files as tabs at the top of that panel. Those files are usually the ones that you need to edit to complete the example on this page.</description>

      <description>Now that you’ve seen a few pages in Codio, let’s take a minute to discuss some of the features of the Codio user interface. Of course, Codio has some amazing documentation, so feel free to check that out as you work with Codio.&#xA;First, let’s look at the menu items at the top of the page. There are several available to you that are worth mentioning. For starters, you can click the Codio Icon at any time to go directly to your Codio dashboard.</description>

      <title>Important Notes</title>

      <description>CC 210 Is 4 Credit Hours The University guidance is you should spend 12 hours per week on a 4 credit hour course. We interpret this to mean twelve 50 minute sessions and assume you spend some time studying and reviewing class materials which is not captured in Codio. Historically, average students come close to this goal, with some weeks going over and the early weeks being low.&#xA;Caveats:&#xA;We assume that when given two weeks for a project, the “effort” is split equally between both weeks.</description>

      <title>Completing a Unit</title>
      <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/0a-codio-intro/06-completing/</link>

      <description>That’s it! We’ve completed this unit in Codio, and we are now on the last page.&#xA;There’s just one more thing to do: we need to mark the unit as complete. When we do that, Codio will grade our work and then send the grade to Canvas. Once the grade is recorded in Canvas, we’ll get access to the next item in the module.&#xA;Take a Breather Once you’ve marked a unit complete in Codio, it may take several minutes for the grading process to complete and for your grade to appear in Canvas.</description>
