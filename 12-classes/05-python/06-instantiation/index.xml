      <description>Resources Slides Video Script Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve added attributes and methods to our classes, we can explore how to use them in our programs.
In this example, we&amp;rsquo;re assuming that we are writing code in a separate Python file from the one that contains our class. While this isn&amp;rsquo;t required, it is a very good practice to get into, since most other programming languages follow the same structure. However, we are assuming that those files are contained in the same directory on the filesystem in this case.</description>
