    <description>You will notice that each feature of the class Car is labeled with a plus or minus sign. This informs programmers how to control access to the feature.&#xA;+ Public Public access means the code outside of the class definition are expected to be able to access this feature. Generically this is referred to as “public”. Constructors are almost always public, as are many methods.&#xA;- Private Private access means that this feature should only be referenced by code inside of the class definition.</description>
