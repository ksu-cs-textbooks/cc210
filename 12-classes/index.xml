      <description>1&#xA;Lets take a second look at classes. This time, rather than focusing on a single object-class, we will have several interconnected object classes, introduce class-level features and the concepts of properties and access permission.&#xA;Some of the material in this module will be review.&#xA;Image Credit: https://all-free-download.com/free-vector/download/nature-background-bird-cloud-tree-icons-paper-cut_6830935.html ↩︎</description>

      <description>Class Attributes Consider the above UML for a car. It has 3 “class level” attributes, those underlined in the UML. These are variables that belong to the class, not a particular instance, and thus are shared by all the instances. Class features are denoted by an underline on the UML.&#xA;The Ford F-Series truck is a well selling truck model. If we were to write a program dealing with the manufacture and sales of this truck, we would have millions of instances.</description>

      <description>You will notice that each feature of the class Car is labeled with a plus or minus sign. This informs programmers how to control access to the feature.&#xA;+ Public Public access means the code outside of the class definition are expected to be able to access this feature. Generically this is referred to as “public”. Constructors are almost always public, as are many methods.&#xA;- Private Private access means that this feature should only be referenced by code inside of the class definition.</description>

      <description>Because OOP generally results in private fields (variables), early OOP programmers were swamped with writing accessor and mutator methods. These methods had the sole function of providing a ‘public’ way of getting or setting the private field. It became so common that many programming languages developed a special “hybrid” syntax^[in some languages, properties are a special ’type’, in others they are normal class fields with just a bit of syntactic sugar.</description>

      <description>In this chapter, we learned how to build classes into our programs to represent things, either real-world items or virtual concepts. Using those classes, we can then instantiate objects that we can use in our programs, with each object representing a unique instance of a sort of item.&#xA;Using classes is a core concept in object-oriented programming, and it really helps us organize larger programs into smaller pieces of code, where each piece is a logical division of the program as a whole.</description>
