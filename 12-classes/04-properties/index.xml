    <description>Because OOP generally results in private fields (variables), early OOP programmers were swamped with writing accessor and mutator methods. These methods had the sole function of providing a ‘public’ way of getting or setting the private field. It became so common that many programming languages developed a special “hybrid” syntax^[in some languages, properties are a special ’type’, in others they are normal class fields with just a bit of syntactic sugar.</description>
