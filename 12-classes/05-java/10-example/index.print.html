<h1 id="a-worked-example">A Worked Example</h1>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve learned all about how to make our own classes and objects, we can practice our skills by building an example program together. This will be a larger program than many of the programs we&rsquo;ve worked with so far, but hopefully it will actually be easier to follow since the code is separated into several classes.</p>
<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>For this example, we&rsquo;ll build a program to play a version of the game of Blackjack, also known as Twenty-One. The rules of this simplified game are fairly straightforward:</p>
<ol>
<li>The game consists of a single player playing against the dealer, played by our program in this example.</li>
<li>Each player is initially dealt two cards from a standard 52 card deck. Each card&rsquo;s value is its face value, with face cards valued 10 and aces valued 11.</li>
<li>The object of the game is to get a higher total value than the other player, without going over 21.</li>
<li>The game consists of several steps:
<ol>
<li>Both the player and the dealer review the two cards they are dealt. Both the player and the dealer can see the opponent&rsquo;s hand as well.</li>
<li>The player is given the option to draw additional cards. The player may continue to draw cards until she or he chooses to stop, or their total value is greater than 21.</li>
<li>If the player stops before going over 21, the dealer must draw cards to try to beat the player. The dealer stops drawing cards when the dealer&rsquo;s total beats the player&rsquo;s or exceeds 21.</li>
<li>At the end, the participant with the greatest card value that is less than or equal to 21 wins the game. If it is a tie, the dealer wins.
As you may be able to tell, this game differs a bit from the rules of traditional Blackjack. Those changes mainly help to simplify the program a bit, so we can focus on the structure of the classes we need to build instead of on the rules.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can find the full rules to Blackjack on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack" rel="external" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="program-structure">Program Structure</h2>
<p>In order to build this program, we&rsquo;ll need to implement several classes to represent the objects needed for the game. For now, we&rsquo;ll follow this UML diagram to help guide the design of this program. In later chapters, you&rsquo;ll learn the skills needed to design your own program structures from scratch, but when learning to program it is sometimes easier to first read different program structures before writing your own.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-d33e09b55673196eb8161fec0e486404" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Blackjack UML Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/12-class/11.6.j.10.blackjack.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-d33e09b55673196eb8161fec0e486404"><img alt="Blackjack UML Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/12-class/11.6.j.10.blackjack.png"></a></p>
<p>This program will contain several classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Card—This class represents a single card in a deck, containing a suit and a value.</li>
<li>Deck—This class represents the entire deck of cards, consisting of 52 cards.</li>
<li>Hand—This class represents a single player&rsquo;s hand of cards from the deck.</li>
<li>Dealer—This class implements the dealer&rsquo;s actions.</li>
<li>Player—This class implements the player&rsquo;s actions.</li>
<li>Main—This class controls the program and contains the <code>main()</code> function.</li>
</ul>
<p>To build this program, we&rsquo;ll address each class individually. That allows us to build the program one piece at a time, and allows us to test it at each step to make sure it is working correctly.</p>
<h2 id="card-class"><code>Card</code> Class</h2>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n7sPtYCdUg">YouTube Video</a>

<p><a href="/cc210/12-classes/05-java/10-example/video/">Video Materials</a></p>
<p>The first and simplest class we can build is the <code>Card</code> class. This class represents a single card from a deck of cards, and contains the <code>suit</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>value</code> attributes. Since we don&rsquo;t want those values to be edited outside of this class, we can use private attributes paired with getter methods for them. For the value, we&rsquo;ll use an integer to make the rest of the program simpler.</p>

<p>Next, we&rsquo;ll need a class that can represent an entire deck of cards. This class will contain an array of cards, as well as some helpful methods we can use to shuffle the deck and deal individual cards.</p>

It creates a new array of 52 cards, then an array of Strings representing the suits. It also uses the <code>card_number</code> variable to keep track of the position of the last card added to the deck. Finally, we have two <strong>For</strong> loops to go through each suit and each card number from 1 to 13, creating the full deck of 52 cards.</p>
<p>Next, we can add a method to print out the entire deck of cards. Once again, we&rsquo;ll just override the <code>toString()</code> method:</p>

<p>As we can see, we are creating a full deck of cards, but they aren&rsquo;t in a random order. While we could just implement a method to draw cards randomly from the deck, it might be just as useful to implement a method to shuffle the deck. So, let&rsquo;s do that now!</p>

Then, it will swap the cards in the deck at those two locations. It is slow and simple, but thankfully a computer can do thousands of those operations in a few milliseconds, so it works just fine for our needs.</p>
<p>Now, we can update the code in our <code>main()</code> function to see that it is working correctly:</p>

</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="p">}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>That should produce a random deck, as shown in this screenshot:</p>

<p>Finally, we can add a method to deal a card from the deck to a player. To do this, we&rsquo;ll add another private attribute to keep track of the position we are dealing from in the deck. Then, we can return the appropriate card from our method.</p>

This method will simply return the front-most card from the deck that hasn&rsquo;t already been used. We aren&rsquo;t actually removing the cards from the list, but rather just incrementing a variable keeping track of the position in the list to remember which cards we&rsquo;ve already dealt.</p>
<p>That should complete the <code>Deck</code> class! The assessments below will confirm that the code structure and functionality is correct before moving on.</p>

<p>Next, we can create a simple class that represents a hand of cards. So, it will need an array of Card objects just like the <code>Deck</code> class. Since we don&rsquo;t know how many cards would be in the largest hand, we&rsquo;ll just use 52 as the size of this array as well. In a later chapter, we&rsquo;ll learn about <em>resizable arrays</em> and other data structures so that we don&rsquo;t have to worry about having enough room to store our data in a statically-sized array.</p>
<p>To start, we can create our array of cards and a constructor, as well as an integer to keep track of how many cards we have in our hand:</p>

In essence, we use a <strong>For</strong> loop to loop through the cards in our hand, and then either sum up the values or get the string representation of each card. Notice that we are using a <strong>For</strong> loop with an iterator variable that goes from 0 to the number of cards in the hand, instead of using an <strong>Enhanced For</strong> loop. This is because the array itself will probably never be completely full, so we only want to print out the cards that we are actually using in our hand.</p>
<p>Lastly, we need to create a method that allows us to add a card to our hand. So, we can implement the <code>addCard()</code> method as well:</p>

<p>Now that we have implemented the classes needed to keep track of the cards, we can create the classes that will actually perform the actions for each player. First, we can implement the code for the <code>Dealer</code> class. This class is actually pretty simple, since it will only consist of a couple of methods: <code>makeMoves()</code>, which will perform all the actions needed for the dealer, and a <code>toString()</code> method to print the contents of the dealer&rsquo;s hand. In addition, the dealer will need an attribute to store a hand, which can be populated in the constructor by a parameter:</p>

In addition, the constructor was renamed to <code>init()</code> since we won&rsquo;t actually be using the constructor to build an object. Finally, we also have to rename the <code>toString()</code> method to <code>getString()</code> since the <code>toString()</code> method cannot be static. We&rsquo;ll see why that would be a problem in a later chapter as we learn about method inheritance.</p>
<p>Then, once we&rsquo;ve made that choice, we can draw a new card from the deck in our code anywhere simply by using the <code>Deck.draw()</code> method.</p>
<p>This approach has several advantages and disadvantages. It requires very few changes in our code, and once the <code>Deck</code> class is modified, we can use the methods from that class anywhere in our code, which can be very helpful.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the major downside of this approach is that we can now only have a single deck of cards in our entire game. For most games, that won&rsquo;t be an issue, but it could be a limitation in other programs. In addition, as we may learn in a later class, there are some standard ways to accomplish this, such as the <em>singleton design pattern</em>, that are more familiar to developers.</p>
<p>So, for this example, we won&rsquo;t be using a <code>Deck</code> class that contains entirely static methods and attributes.</p>
<h3 id="option-2-pass-deck-object-to-dealer-class">Option 2: Pass <code>Deck</code> Object to <code>Dealer</code> Class</h3>
<p>The second way this could be handled is to create an object from the <code>Deck</code> class in our <code>Main</code> class, then pass that object as a parameter to the constructor for the <code>Dealer</code> object. In that way, the dealer has a <em>reference</em> to the deck that is stored in our main class (recall that all objects are handled in a <em>call by reference</em> manner).</p>
<p>So, we can update the constructor for our <code>Dealer</code> class to accept a <code>Deck</code> object, and then we&rsquo;ll store it as a private variable in the class:</p>

This gives the <code>Dealer</code> class a reference to the deck that we are using, allowing it to draw cards as needed.</p>
<p>This approach also has several pros and cons. First, we don&rsquo;t have to modify our Deck class at all, meaning that it can remain a simple object. Instead, we are modifying how we use it by including a reference to it in our other classes. This is a more standard approach for programs written in an object-oriented style, in Java and other languages.</p>
<p>As a downside, this does mean that we&rsquo;ll have to make sure our other classes all are given a reference to a <code>Deck</code> object. In larger programs, handling all of these object references can become very cumbersome and time-consuming. Again, in a future course we can learn about <em>design patterns</em> that help simplify this process, too.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll use this approach in our example program here.</p>
<p>That should complete the <code>Dealer</code> class! The assessments below will confirm that the code structure and functionality is correct before moving on.</p>
<h2 id="player-class"><code>Player</code> Class</h2>

<p><a href="/cc210/12-classes/05-java/10-example/video/">Video Materials</a></p>
<p>The player class is nearly identical to the <code>Dealer</code> class. The only difference is that the player class will ask the player to decide whether to draw more cards. In addition, the player may draw until their value is greater than 21, without regard to the score from the dealer. This is the one interactive part of the entire program:</p>

THen, we can ask the user at each step whether they would like to draw another card.</p>
<p>That should complete the <code>Player</code> class! The assessments below will confirm that the code structure is correct before moving on. We won&rsquo;t worry about testing the functionality here, since that is really best done by a live player!</p>

<p>Finally, we can work on implementing our <code>Main</code> class. This class is very simple, only containing the <code>main()</code> method for the program. The <code>main</code> method will set up the deck and deal a hand for each player, then allow both the player and the dealer to make moves before finally getting the result to see who wins:</p>

<ol>
<li>First, the deck is initialized and shuffled.</li>
<li>Then, the player&rsquo;s hand is dealt, and the <code>Player</code> object is initialized. Once that is done, it prints the contents of the player&rsquo;s hand.</li>
<li>Similarly, the <code>Dealer</code> is initialized, given a hand, and the contents are printed.</li>
<li>Then, it proceeds to the player&rsquo;s turn. The player can then draw cards until she chooses to stop or go over the value of 21.</li>
<li>Next, the dealer is given a turn. The dealer is also given the value of the player&rsquo;s hand, so the dealer only has to match or beat the player&rsquo;s value to win.</li>
<li>Finally, the game determines the winner.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a sample of this program&rsquo;s output when run in the terminal:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-04b2fd37e533b48bde7834e31311bb37" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Java Program Output" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc210/images/12-class/11.6.j.10.java_output.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>There we go! We were able to build a program that plays a simple version of Blackjack. While it took a bit of work to get all of the required classes developed, each one was pretty straightforward and easy to use. Then, in our <code>main()</code> method, we simply had to pull all those resources together into a working program.</p>
<p>The assessments below will verify that the entire example program works as intended, except for the <code>Main</code> and <code>Player</code> classes. This is because it can be very difficult to complete those classes in a way that is easy to test automatically. They exist mainly to allow us to interact with the objects we&rsquo;ve created.</p>
