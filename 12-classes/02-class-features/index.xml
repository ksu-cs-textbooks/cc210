    <title>Class Features :: CC 210 Textbook</title>

    <description>Class Attributes Consider the above UML for a car. It has 3 “class level” attributes, those underlined in the UML. These are variables that belong to the class, not a particular instance, and thus are shared by all the instances. Class features are denoted by an underline on the UML.&#xA;The Ford F-Series truck is a well selling truck model. If we were to write a program dealing with the manufacture and sales of this truck, we would have millions of instances.</description>
