<h1 id="operation">Operation</h1>
<p>Computer Science, and therefore programming, has its roots in mathematics and uses a lot technical terms and jargon from math.  Unfortunately this means that most programmers need to be familiar with some of this jargon.</p>
<p>An <strong>operation</strong> is a fancy math term for &ldquo;do something&rdquo;, but carries with it its own set of vocabulary. An operation is composed of:</p>
<ol>
<li>an <strong>operator</strong> (one or more symbols)</li>
<li><strong>operands</strong> (one or more pieces of data)</li>
<li>a semantic meaning (i.e. what the operator does)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="binary-operations">Binary Operations</h2>
<p>Binary operations operate on two inputs. This class of operations should be familiar from arithmetic.  Its format is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">    operand1 operator operand2
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        2     +        4
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        x     +        y</span></span></code></pre></div><p>where the operator is typically some type of symbol.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Binary Operations</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>Note that in this case the term <strong>binary</strong> refers to the fact that the operation is performed on exactly 2 operands, and not that the data is stored in a base-2 (binary) data format.</p>
<p>This can lead to some confusion among programmers when referring to bitwise operators, which are operators that perform actions on individual bits in a piece of data. Many programmers mistakenly call these &ldquo;binary&rdquo; operators since they operate on data at the binary level, but the proper term is &ldquo;bitwise&rdquo; operators.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Operator symbols are typically overloaded in programming languages, which means that they can do different things based on the types of the operands.  For example, a typical language might do any of the following operations when the plus sign <code>+</code> is used as the operator, depending on the types of the individual operands:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type Operand 1</th>
<th>Type Operand 2</th>
<th>Result Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>int <br> 2</td>
<td>int <br> 4</td>
<td>int <br> 6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>int <br> 2</td>
<td>float <br> 4.0</td>
<td>float <br> 6.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>float <br> 1.1</td>
<td>float <br> 3.7</td>
<td>float <br> 4.8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>String <br> &ldquo;2&rdquo;</td>
<td>String <br> &ldquo;4&rdquo;</td>
<td>String <br> &ldquo;24&rdquo;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>String <br> &ldquo;2&rdquo;</td>
<td>int <br> 4</td>
<td><strong>Error</strong> operation not defined for an operand of type String and int</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We will have to refer to our language&rsquo;s documentation for how each operator functions. Operator behavior, particularly in the presence of mixed-type operands varies from language to language.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Infix vs. Prefix</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>The form <code>operand1 operator operand2</code> is called infix notation.  However, there is another construct called prefix, that looks like <code>operator operand1 operand2</code> or <code>  + 2 4</code>.  For technical reasons it is easier to write programming languages that use prefix notation.  In OOP, we may see prefix notations used for methods and classes, which were adapted from a functional programming language where prefix notation is more common.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="unary-operations">Unary Operations</h2>
<p>There are some operations that have just one operand, these are called unary operations.  The typical form is <code>operator operand</code> or  <code>operand operator</code>.  A fairly common unary operator is <code>!</code> for the logical operation &ldquo;not&rdquo;.  <code>!True</code> is the same as <code>False</code>. We&rsquo;ll introduce more of these operators in a later chapter.</p>
