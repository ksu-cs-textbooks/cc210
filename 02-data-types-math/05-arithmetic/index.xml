    <description>Once we have data stored in our programs, there are a number of ways we can manipulate that data. Letâ€™s look at a few of them here.&#xA;Basic Operations At its core, a computer is capable of performing all of the basic arithmetic operations, so we can write programs that can add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers. However, there is one big caveat that must be dealt with.&#xA;As discussed on the previous page, computer programs can store numbers as both integers and floating point numbers.</description>
