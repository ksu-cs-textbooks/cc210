    <description>In a computer, all data, even the instructions, is stored in a binary format. Binary data consist entirely of 1s and 0s, or, in the case of a computer, it could be represented as “on” and “off” for current in a circuit, or “positive” and “negative” charges stored on a magnetic storage device. It could even be “open” and “closed” for physical memory gates. There are many different ways to represent it, but it all boils down to just 1s and 0s.</description>
