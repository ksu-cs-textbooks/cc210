      <description>1&#xA;Everything in the world can be represented using data. Think about that for a minute. Does it make sense?&#xA;Picture a tree. That tree can be described by its width, height, age, number of leaves, and even its color or texture. What about a person? A person has a name, age, height, and many other attributes. Could we simply represent trees, humans, and other entities in our computer programs using their attributes?</description>

      <description>Video Materials&#xA;First, let’s talk about variables. A variable is a placeholder for another value in a computer program. Most students first learn about variables in a mathematics course, such as Algebra. For example, in math, we might see the equation $ x + 5 = 10 $, where $ x $ is a variable, or placeholder, for a value. Using the algebraic rules, we can solve that equation to find that $ x = 5 $.</description>

      <description>In a computer, all data, even the instructions, is stored in a binary format. Binary data consist entirely of 1s and 0s, or, in the case of a computer, it could be represented as “on” and “off” for current in a circuit, or “positive” and “negative” charges stored on a magnetic storage device. It could even be “open” and “closed” for physical memory gates. There are many different ways to represent it, but it all boils down to just 1s and 0s.</description>

      <description>A variable in a high level language is just a memory address. It tells the compiler/interpreter where to start looking for the binary string of data.&#xA;Decoding the binary All high-level programming languages use a type system to tell the system how to decode the binary data it finds there. All types have a size and a semantic which describes how many bits are in the data and how to interpret each bit.</description>

      <description>Once we have data stored in our programs, there are a number of ways we can manipulate that data. Let’s look at a few of them here.&#xA;Basic Operations At its core, a computer is capable of performing all of the basic arithmetic operations, so we can write programs that can add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers. However, there is one big caveat that must be dealt with.&#xA;As discussed on the previous page, computer programs can store numbers as both integers and floating point numbers.</description>

      <description>Operation Computer Science, and therefore programming, has its roots in mathematics and uses a lot technical terms and jargon from math. Unfortunately this means that most programmers need to be familiar with some of this jargon.&#xA;An operation is a fancy math term for “do something”, but carries with it its own set of vocabulary. An operation is composed of:&#xA;an operator (one or more symbols) operands (one or more pieces of data) a semantic meaning (i.</description>

      <title>User Input</title>

      <description>Most programs process some type of user input, either text input by the user, mouse clicks on the screen, or many other methods. In this course, we’ll typically deal with three different types of user inputs:&#xA;Command-line arguments Reading from a file stream Reading from the keyboard stream For the first few chapters, we’ll go ahead and provide the code needed to handle and process user inputs. As we learn more, we’ll go deeper into detail about each method and discuss the nuances involved with reading and processing user input.</description>

      <description>We’ve now learned a lot about variables and data types in our programming language. We can use this information to build programs that store and manipulate large amounts of information.&#xA;We still have quite a bit to learn before we have the basics of programming covered. As we continue, we’ll see the usefulness of variables and the various data types we’ve learned.</description>
