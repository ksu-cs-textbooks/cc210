    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/02-data-types-math/01-world-as-data/</link>
    <description>1&#xA;Everything in the world can be represented using data. Think about that for a minute. Does it make sense?&#xA;Picture a tree. That tree can be described by its width, height, age, number of leaves, and even its color or texture. What about a person? A person has a name, age, height, and many other attributes. Could we simply represent trees, humans, and other entities in our computer programs using their attributes?</description>
