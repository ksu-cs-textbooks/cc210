    <title>Numbers :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/02-data-types-math/08-python/02-numbers/</link>
    <description>Most of the computer programs we’ll write must deal with numbers in some way. So, it makes perfect sense to start working with the numerical data types, since we’ll use them very often. Let’s dive in and see how we can use these numerical data types in Python!&#xA;Python has several built-in classes for representing numbers, text and logical values. All Python variables thus refer to full fledged objects.&#xA;Integers The first data type we’ll learn about in Python is the one for storing whole numbers, called int class.</description>
