      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script We all probably learned the acronym PEMDAS for the order of operations in mathematics. It stands for parentheses, exponents, multiplication &amp;amp; division, addition &amp;amp; subtraction. When faced with a large math equation, we can use this list to understand which operations should be performed first.
Programming languages such as Python also enforce an order of operations. In fact, it is very similar to the one we&amp;rsquo;re already familiar with from math.</description>
