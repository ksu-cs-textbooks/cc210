    <title>User Input :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/02-data-types-math/07-user-input/</link>
    <description>Most programs process some type of user input, either text input by the user, mouse clicks on the screen, or many other methods. In this course, we’ll typically deal with three different types of user inputs:&#xA;Command-line arguments Reading from a file stream Reading from the keyboard stream For the first few chapters, we’ll go ahead and provide the code needed to handle and process user inputs. As we learn more, we’ll go deeper into detail about each method and discuss the nuances involved with reading and processing user input.</description>
