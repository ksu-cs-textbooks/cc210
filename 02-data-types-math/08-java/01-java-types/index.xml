    <description>The Java programming language is a statically typed language. This means that each and every variable we use in our programs must be declared with a name and a type before we can use it. The Java compiler can then perform a step known as type checking, which verifies that we are using the proper data types in our program.&#xA;The major advantage of this approach is that many errors in our computer programs can be discovered by the compiler, well before we ever try to run the program directly.</description>
