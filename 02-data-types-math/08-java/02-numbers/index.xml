    <title>Numbers :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/02-data-types-math/08-java/02-numbers/</link>
    <description>Most of the computer programs we’ll write must deal with numbers in some way. So, it makes perfect sense to start working with the numerical data types, since we’ll use them very often. Let’s dive in and see how we can use these numerical data types in Java!&#xA;Java has built in primitive types for various numeric, text and logic values. A variable in Java can refer to either a primitive type or a full fledged object.</description>
