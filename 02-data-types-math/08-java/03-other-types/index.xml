    <description>Beyond numbers, there are a few other primitive data types in Java. Let’s take a quick look at them and see how they can be used in our programs.&#xA;Boolean Java supports a primitive data type named boolean that can only store two values: true and false. As we might expect, we can use these boolean variables to store answers to questions in our program, such as “Is x greater than y?</description>
