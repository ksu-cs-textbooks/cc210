<p>Now let&rsquo;s see if we can write our own program that deals with files and directories. For starters, let&rsquo;s take a look at the problem statement.</p>
<p>Whaaaa? That looks pretty complex. Just like we do with all of these examples, let&rsquo;s break it down into smaller parts and see if we can build it one step at a time.</p>
<p>For starter, we need to build a program that accepts 3 files as command-line arguments. If there aren&rsquo;t exactly 3 arguments, we should print an error and exit the program. So, we can use a simple If-Then statement to handle this part of the problem.</p>
<p>Next, we know that the first two files are input files that we need to read, and the third file is an output file that we should write to. So, we&rsquo;ll need to try and open these files for reading and writing. To do that, we&rsquo;ll use a Try with Resources statement, and import the various libraries we need to accomplish that task.</p>
<p>Now we can think about the possible exceptions. We&rsquo;ll have to consider an InvalidPathException, a NoSuchFileException if we try to open a file for reading that doesn&rsquo;t exist, as well as an IOException if we run into any issues reading or writing to any of these files. In each case, we&rsquo;ll just print out the message &ldquo;Invalid Arguments&rdquo; and use the <code>return</code> keyword to exit the program.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all we need for our starter code. So, let&rsquo;s dive in deeper. We&rsquo;ll place the following code where this &ldquo;more code goes here&rdquo; comment is in our starter code.</p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve opened the files, we&rsquo;ll need to read the contents of the two input files. According to the problem statement, each one contains a list of whole numbers, one per line. So, we&rsquo;ll create two While loops, one for each file, and inside of the loop we&rsquo;ll read lines of input from the file until we run out.</p>
<p>Next, we can convert that input to an integer. However, this could cause an exception to occur if the input cannot be converted to an integer, so we&rsquo;ll need to go back to our starter code and add an additional catch statement to handle a NumberFormatException. In that case, we&rsquo;ll print the &ldquo;Invalid Input&rdquo; message.</p>
<p>So, back to our inner code. The program should keep track of the sum and count of both the even and odd inputs from each file. So, we&rsquo;ll use a simple If-Then statement to determine if the input is even or odd. Then, inside of those If-Then statements, we&rsquo;ll update the variables for the count and sum of each type of number. It seems like quite a bit of code, but it should hopefully be pretty straightforward to see how it works.</p>
<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll need to write some output to the output file. To make it easier to read, we&rsquo;ll place that code where the &ldquo;more code goes here&rdquo; comment is in this code.</p>
<p>The output is also pretty simple. The problem statement gives us an example of what it should look like. We&rsquo;ll just print the four numbers, each on a separate line, in the order given. In this example, I&rsquo;m using a quick shortcut to convert each number to a string by simply concatenating it after an empty string. Finally, we&rsquo;re using the <code>newLine()</code> method to print a newline character between each number, so they will be on separate lines in the output file.</p>
<p>Lastly, we should make sure we remember to print &ldquo;Complete&rdquo; to the terminal before exiting. In this case, we&rsquo;ll need to use the <code>System.out.println()</code> method to make sure it appears on the terminal and not in our input file.</p>
<p>The problem statement also helpfully reminds us to make sure we close any open files when we are done with them. Thankfully since we are using a Try with Resources statement, that part is automatically handled for us!</p>
<p>There we go! That&rsquo;s all it takes to build this simple program in Java to explore reading and writing with files. See if you can get it to work yourself!</p>
