<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how we can write to files in Java. To do this, we&rsquo;ll use another class named BufferedWriter, which handles opening and writing to files.</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;ll need to declare and initialize a new BufferedWriter object. Just like we did with file input, we can use a Try with Resources statement to do this, which will ensure that the file is properly closed when we are done with it. Outside of that statement, we&rsquo;ll add a catch block for a generic exception for now, but we&rsquo;ll revisit that in a bit.</p>
<p>With all of this code, we need to import several classes to make it work. We&rsquo;ll need to import the BufferedWriter class from java.io, the Files class from java.nio.file, and the Paths class, also from java.nio.file.</p>
<p>There! That gives us the basic structure we need to write to a file. In this program, we are getting the filename from the first command-line argument, but we could easily substitute that for any string that contains a path to a file.</p>
<p>To write to the file, we can just use the <code>write()</code> method of the <code>writer</code> object. It accepts only strings, unlike the <code>System.out.println</code> method we&rsquo;ve been using to output text to the terminal. So, we&rsquo;ll need to make sure we convert any output to a string when writing it to a file.</p>
<p>However, by default, the <code>write()</code> method does not add a newline at the end of the output, so we can call a second method, <code>newLine()</code> to print a newline character to our file.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it! Writing to a file in Java is pretty simple. However, to make this program truly robust, there are a few exceptions we should catch and handle.</p>
<p>First, since we are reading the name of the file from the command-line arguments, we need to make sure we don&rsquo;t have an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Similarly, since we are using the Paths class, we can also check for an InvalidPathException.</p>
<p>In addition, any input and output operations could cause an IOException, so we&rsquo;ll need to add another catch statement for that.</p>
<p>Finally, opening a file for writing can cause one additional exception, the UnsupportedOperationException. This occurs when we are unable to open a file for writing for some reason, usually due to operating system restrictions. So, we can add one more catch statement for that exception as well.</p>
<p>This code gives a very simple example for writing output to a file. While it looks very complex, most of the program is simply code to handle the various exceptions that could occur when opening and writing to a file. See if you can get the example on this page to work!</p>
