</p>
<p>Lastly, let&rsquo;s take a look at some helpful commands we can use on the terminal to manipulate the file system in Linux. We can open the terminal in Codio by clicking the <strong>Tools</strong> menu at the top of the page, then selecting <strong>Terminal</strong>. It should already be open in the panel to the left for this example.</p>
<p>When we open the terminal, it should look something like the picture below. If we see that, we&rsquo;re ready to go.</p>
<p>

</a></p>
<h2 id="command-prompt">Command Prompt</h2>
<p>When we open a Linux terminal, we&rsquo;ll see quite a bit of helpful information before we even type in a single command. In the screenshot above, the terminal&rsquo;s <em>command prompt</em> is the line of text right before the cursor:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>codio@rainbow-almond:~/workspace<span style="color:#e6db74">$</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s look at what each part means:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>codio</code> - The first part, before the at symbol <code>@</code>, gives the currently logged-in user name. When using Codio, we&rsquo;ll almost always be logged-in using the <code>codio</code> username.</li>
<li><code>@rainbow-almond</code> - The next segment, between the at symbol <code>@</code> and the colon <code>:</code> is the <em>host name</em> of the system we are using. Codio assigns hostnames using two random words, in this case &ldquo;rainbow&rdquo; and &ldquo;almond&rdquo;. We won&rsquo;t really need this information right now, but it will become useful in future courses.</li>
<li><code>~/workspace</code> - Following the colon is the path of the <em>present working directory</em> or <em>pwd</em> for short. This is the directory we are currently in.</li>
<li><code>$</code> - The last character is a dollar sign <code>$</code>. It is used to signify that we are not on an <em>elevated</em> terminal, which would have administrator permissions. If we were on an elevated terminal, it would be a hash symbol <code>#</code> instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, the command prompt gives quite a bit of important information at a glance!</p>
<h2 id="print-working-directory">Print Working Directory</h2>
<p>At any time, we can see our <em>working directory</em> one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is always present in the command prompt on most Linux terminals as described above.</li>
<li>We can use the <code>pwd</code> command (short for &ldquo;Print Working Directory&rdquo;) on the terminal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try the second option. On a terminal, we can type <code>pwd</code> and press enter. It should look something like this:</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-e92f8b039035dd6afd8b7cb607fb8202" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/11-file/pwd.png" alt="Present Working Directory Screenshot" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">
</a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox" id="image-e92f8b039035dd6afd8b7cb607fb8202">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/11-file/pwd.png" alt="Present Working Directory Screenshot" class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>When we enter that command, the next line will show us our current working directory. However, notice that it printed <code>/home/codio/workspace</code> instead of the <code>~/workspace</code> that we see in the command prompt. This is because Linux uses several special characters in a <em>path</em> as shortcuts. So, let&rsquo;s cover that before we move on.</p>
<h2 id="special-path-characters">Special Path Characters</h2>
<p>As we discussed earlier, the Linux file system uses a hierarchical path to show the location of directories and folders. However, sometimes those paths can be very complex, and it is a pain to type them out in full each time we want to use them. So, there are a few special rules and characters that apply to Linux paths.</p>
<ol>
<li>If a path begins with a slash <code>/</code> character, the path is said to be an <em>absolute</em> path. That is because it starts at the root of the file system, and gives the name of each directory along the path. If it does not begin with a slash, then the path is a <em>relative</em> path, because it is relative to our present working directory and could have different meanings depending on which directory we are starting from.</li>
<li>If a path begins with a tilde and a slash <code>~/</code>, the path is relative to our <em>home directory</em>. So, the path <code>/home/codio/workspace</code> and <code>~/workspace</code> are the same, provided our current username is <code>codio</code>.</li>
<li>If a path begins with a period and a slash <code>./</code>, the path is relative to our <em>present working directory</em>. So, if our <em>pwd</em> is <code>/home/codio</code>, then the path <code>./workspace</code> is the same as <code>/home/codio/workspace</code>.</li>
<li>If a path begins with two periods and a slash <code>../</code>, the path is relative to the <em>parent directory</em> of our present working directory. So, if our <em>pwd</em> is <code>/home/codio/workspace</code>, the path <code>../</code> would be the same as <code>/home/codio</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few other special characters that can be used, but these are the ones that we&rsquo;ll see most often.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle tip">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Chaining Paths</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>It is also possible to chain paths together using several of these special characters. For example, if our <em>pwd</em> is <code>/home/codio/workspace</code>, the path <code>../../</code> would be <code>/home</code>, and <code>../../../</code> would be just <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can chain them together in ways that may seem nonsensical, such as <code>~/../../././home/codio/../codio/workspace</code>, which is the same path as <code>/home/codio/workspace</code>.</p>
<p>In general, we won&rsquo;t need to use these complex paths very often if at all. However, it is helpful to know that it can be done.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="listing-contents">Listing Contents</h2>
<p>Next, we can list the contents in a directory using the <code>ls</code> command. Let&rsquo;s go ahead and enter that next on our terminal:</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-2183c377c4f24bbc9a55bdb9524253c4" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/11-file/ls.png" alt="ls Screenshot" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">
</a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox" id="image-2183c377c4f24bbc9a55bdb9524253c4">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/11-file/ls.png" alt="ls Screenshot" class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>Assuming we are still at the <code>/home/codio/workspace</code> directory, we should see output similar to the screenshot above. Of course, many files have been added to this book since that screenshot was made, so it may be different now. In that screenshot, we see some interesting things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any entries that are blue represent <em>directories</em> that can be opened. They may contain additional files or directories, or they may be empty.</li>
<li>Entries in white are <em>files</em> that can be opened</li>
</ol>
<p>Since it is difficult for some people to see those colors, we can also use the <code>ls -l</code> command to show more information:</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-0d2e1860fbeddf6625ef73c1399dedde" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc210/images/11-file/lsl.png" alt="ls -l Screenshot" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">

</a></p>
<p>This gives us quite a bit more information about each directory or file. Here&rsquo;s a helpful diagram from DigitalOcean showing what each column contains:</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-fbfb6d7d73306e754259aa491e94e667" class="lightbox-link">

</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Another important aspect is the first character in the mode column, which gives the <em>type</em> of the entry:</p>
<ol>
<li>If that character is a <code>d</code>, the entry is a <em>directory</em></li>
<li>If that character is a dash <code>-</code>, the entry is a <em>file</em></li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few other characters that could appear there, but we won&rsquo;t discuss them now.</p>
<h2 id="changing-directories">Changing Directories</h2>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve seen what a directory contains, we may want to open another directory and view its contents. To do that, we can use the <code>cd</code> command, followed by the <em>path</em> that we&rsquo;d like to visit. It could be an <em>absolute path</em> or a <em>relative path</em>. For example, let&rsquo;s assume we are in the <code>/home/codio/workspace</code> directory. From there, we&rsquo;d like to get to the directory <code>/home/codio/workspace/1j-hello</code>, which is contained in the present working directory. Each of the screenshots below gives an example of how we could accomplish that:</p>

<p>So, it is very simple to use the <code>cd</code> command to move around the file system.</p>

  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Autocomplete</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>Tired of always having to type in complex folder names and commands in Linux? Thankfully, most Linux terminals, including the one in Codio, support <em>tab completion</em> of commands and paths. Just start typing the first few characters of a command or part of a path, then press the <strong>TAB</strong> key to try and autocomplete it. If there is only one possible completion of that element, the Linux terminal will fill it in for you.</p>
<p>If it is not unique, you can press <strong>TAB</strong> twice to see all possible ways that the command or path could be completed. This shortcut is one of the many ways a Linux power user gets around the terminal so quickly. It is definitely a trick worth learning!</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="other-commands">Other Commands</h2>
<p>There are several other useful Linux terminal commands that we may need to use from time to time. Most of these commands can also be accomplished using the Codio file tree.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mkdir &lt;path&gt;</code> - make a new directory</li>
<li><code>touch &lt;file&gt;</code> - create a new blank file or update the last modified time of an existing file</li>
<li><code>cat &lt;file&gt;</code> - print a file&rsquo;s contents to the terminal</li>
<li><code>cp &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;</code> - copy a file or directory from the source to the destination. Use <code>cp -r</code> to make it <em>recursive</em>, where it will copy all of the contents inside of a directory as well.</li>
<li><code>mv &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;</code> - move a file or directory from the source to the destination. This is very similar to <em>renaming</em> a file or directory.</li>
<li><code>rm &lt;file&gt;</code> - remove (delete) a file</li>
<li><code>rmdir &lt;directory&gt;</code> - remove (delete) an empty directory</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a small sample of the many commands available on a Linux terminal. For more detailed information, feel free to check out this great video tutorial.</p>

<h4 id="video-script">Video Script</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review some of the important concepts and commands you&rsquo;ll want to know when working with the Linux file system in Codio. Some of this material may be review, but it is helpful to have a quick refresher before starting the programming portion of this chapter.</p>
<p>In Codio, we can open a Terminal in several ways. We can choose the Terminal option from the tools menu, the Terminal button above the file tree, and the Open Terminal option in the Run menu. Any one of those options will get us to the terminal.</p>
<p>Once there, we&rsquo;ll be greeted with the standard Linux command prompt. This gives us several important pieces of information. First, we see our current username, which is <code>codio</code>. After that, there is an at <code>@</code> symbol, and then the name of the Codio box we are using. Codio boxes are given unique two-word names. In this case, it is blah blah.</p>
<p>Next, we have a colon <code>:</code>, and then following that we see the path of our working directory, <code>~/workspace</code>. By default, most times the Codio terminal will automatically open to the <code>workspace</code> directory inside of the home folder, which is where all of our files and work will be placed anyway.</p>
<p>Finally, we see a dollar sign <code>$</code>. That dollar sign indicates that we are using a standard terminal. The other symbol we might see there is a pound sign or hash symbol <code>#</code>, which indicates that we are using an administrative terminal as the <code>root</code> user. For Codio, that really doesn&rsquo;t matter, but on a real Linux system, it means that any commands you run have the permissions of the <code>root</code> user, which means you can install and configure software, but also accidentally break things without warning.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s review some important commands that we can use to navigate the file system in Linux. First, we can use the <code>pwd</code> command to print our working directory. In this case, it will print <code>/home/codio/workspace</code>, which is the directory our terminal is currently using.</p>
<p>Earlier, we said that we were in <code>~/workspace</code>, but the <code>pwd</code> command gives us <code>/home/codio/workspace</code>. So, why is that? It turns out that the tilde character <code>~</code> is one of the special characters we may see in Linux. In this case, it stands for the home directory of the current user. So, for the user named <code>codio</code>, that path would be <code>/home/codio</code>. In fact, on most Linux systems, we can find all user&rsquo;s home directories in the <code>/home</code> directory.</p>
<p>Once we know where we are, we may want to see what files are contained in that directory. So, let&rsquo;s use the <code>ls</code> command to list the files in this directory. When we run this command inside of the Codio textbook, we see folders for a number of chapters in this book.</p>
<p>If we want to see more details, we can use the <code>ll</code> command to get a long listing of the contents. This will show information such as the permissions, owner, groups, size, and last modified time of each of those files. We won&rsquo;t go into too much detail about any of that information in this course, but it&rsquo;s useful to know.</p>
<p>We can also use the <code>la</code> command to list all files in a directory, including hidden files. On Linux, any file or directory whose name begins with a period or dot <code>.</code> is hidden from the user by default. We can show those files using the <code>la</code> command.</p>
<p>Of course, if we want to have a long listing of those files, we can use the <code>ls -al</code> command to combine both commands in one.</p>
<p>Next, we may want to change our current working directory to another directory. To do this, we can use the <code>cd</code> command, followed by the path to a directory that we&rsquo;d like to open. For example, if we want to open the <code>9p-files</code> directory, which is used for this chapter, we can type <code>cd 9p-files</code> to open that directory</p>
<p>Of course, if we want to make things even easier, Linux supports tab completion. So, as we type the name of a directory or file, we can use the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key to autocomplete it. Let&rsquo;s try that with the folder we just opened.</p>
<p>We can also enter full paths with the <code>cd</code> command, such as <code>cd /home/codio/workspace</code> to get back to the workspace folder. We can even use <code>cd ~/workspace</code> to get there too.</p>
<p>There are two other special directory paths we should be aware of. The first is a single period, which represents the current working directory. So, if we do <code>cd .</code>, we won&rsquo;t go anywhere. However, if we want to refer to a file or directory in our current directory, such as the <code>9p-files</code> directory, we can use <code>cd ./9p-files</code> to get there. This becomes really useful if we need to run a script or executable inside of our directories, but we won&rsquo;t worry about that in this course.</p>
<p>The other special directory path is two periods, or <code>..</code>, which refers to the parent of the current working directory. For example, if we are in the <code>9p-files</code> directory, we can use <code>cd ..</code> to go to the parent directory, which is the <code>workspace</code> directory. We can even chain them together, so by doing <code>cd ../../..</code> from here, we&rsquo;ll get to the root of our filesystem!</p>
<p>Now that we are comfortable moving around, let&rsquo;s review a few other commands that we can use to manipulate the filesystem in Codio. First, we can use the <code>mkdir</code> command to make a new directory. Let&rsquo;s do that now, making a new <code>test</code> directory in our <code>workspace</code> directory. Once we&rsquo;ve done that, we can use <code>cd workspace</code> to get into that directory. Notice how I can type the first few letters of the directory, then press the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key to autocomplete the rest of the path. Once you get comfortable using tab completion, you&rsquo;ll use it all the time.</p>
<p>Inside of that directory, we can create a new file using the <code>touch</code> command. Let&rsquo;s create a file named <code>file.txt</code>, so we&rsquo;ll use <code>touch file.txt</code>. The <code>touch</code> command actually is used to update the last modified date of a file, but it can also create a file if one doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Now that the file exists, we can open it in Codio and add some contents. Unfortunately, there isn&rsquo;t a good way to open the visual Codio editor from the terminal, so you&rsquo;ll have to find the file in the file tree to the left and double-click on it there. Let&rsquo;s do that, and add some content. If you aren&rsquo;t able to see it, you may have to close the Codio guide to get access to the full file system.</p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve created a file and added some content, we can print the contents using the <code>cat</code> command. So, let&rsquo;s type <code>cat file.txt</code> and see what happens. Again, the <code>cat</code> command is actually designed to concatenate many files to the terminal, but it can be used to print just a single file as well.</p>
<p>Next, we can use the <code>cp</code> command to copy a file or directory. To make a copy of a file, simply type the <code>cp</code> command, followed by the name or path of the file to be copied, and then the name or path of the destination. So, if we do <code>cp file.txt new.txt</code>, we&rsquo;ll create a new file called <code>new.txt</code> that contains the same content as <code>file.txt</code>. We can use the <code>cat</code> command to make sure the contents are the same.</p>
<p>If we exit the <code>test</code> directory, we can also use the <code>cp</code> command to copy entire directories. However, when we do that, we must use the <code>-r</code> option, which stands for recursive. This will allow <code>cp</code> to copy both the directory and its contents. So, we&rsquo;d type <code>cp -r test newtest</code> to create a new folder called <code>newtest</code> that contains copies of the files in <code>test</code>. We can use the <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code> and <code>cat</code> commands to confirm that everything worked like we want.</p>
<p>We can also use the <code>mv</code> command to move a file, either by giving it a new name, or an entirely new path. For example, from the <code>newtest</code> directory, we can use <code>mv new.txt second.txt</code> to rename the file <code>new.txt</code> to <code>second.txt</code>.</p>
<p>If we want to move a file to another directory, we can give a new path as the last part of the command. So, for example, if we want to move the file <code>second.txt</code> back to the <code>test</code> directory we created earlier, we can use <code>mv second.txt ../test/</code>. This command is a bit complex. We used the special path <code>..</code> to reference the parent directory, then the <code>test</code> name to get into the <code>test</code> directory contained in that parent directory. Since we left off the file name and ended the path with a slash <code>/</code>, it will know to use the same file name. If we run <code>ls</code> now, we&rsquo;ll see that the file <code>second.txt</code> has disappeared! But, if we use <code>cd ../test</code> to get to that directory, and then <code>ls</code> to see that the file has moved as we intended.</p>
<p>Of course, we can also use the <code>mv</code> command to move entire directories in the same fashion. Thankfully, we don&rsquo;t even have to include any special options if we are moving entire directories.</p>
<p>Lastly, we can use a couple of different commands to delete files and directories we&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>If we enter our <code>newtest</code> directory, we see that there is just one file remaining. <code>file.txt</code>. To delete it, we can use the <code>rm</code> command, as in <code>rm file.txt</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve deleted all of the contents in this folder, we can use <code>cd ..</code> to go to the parent directory. Then, we can use the <code>rmdir</code> command to delete that directory completely by typing <code>rmdir newtest</code>.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that we can only delete directories that are already empty. If we try to do <code>rmdir test</code>, we&rsquo;ll get an error message that the directory is not empty. If we want to delete that directory and all of its contents, we can use the command <code>rm -r test</code> instead. Once again, the <code>-r</code> option stands for recursive, which means that it will delete everything in the directory before deleting the directory itself.</p>
<p>There we go! We&rsquo;ve explored quite a few of the commands we can use to manipulate the Linux file system. Of course, most of these operations can also be performed graphically in the Codio file tree to the left side of the window. Most of those operations should be pretty self-explanatory as well. From here, we&rsquo;ll start learning how to manipulate files and directories from within our programs.</p>
