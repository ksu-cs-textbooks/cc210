<p>Before we start learning how to manipulate files and directories, we should cover some basic concepts related to how computers today deal with data.</p>

  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Trees &amp; Nodes</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll use a few terms that may be unfamiliar. So, let&rsquo;s review those now:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>node</strong>: A <em>node</em> is a single element in a data structure. It is usually represented by a circle or box, and may be connected to other nodes in the data structure using lines.</li>
<li><strong>root</strong>: The single <em>node</em> at the top of a <em>tree</em>.</li>
<li><strong>tree</strong>: A <em>tree</em> is a hierarchical data structure used in computing. A tree typically consists of a single node at the top, and then one or more nodes connected to each node, usually shown in successive layers of depth. When displayed, they typically look like an upside-down tree, with the trunk at the top and branches growing downwards.  The reason trees are drawn upside down, with the root at the top, has been lost to antiquity.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in the diagram above, the entire diagram shows a <em>tree</em> data structure, with each box representing a <em>node</em> of the data structure.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="file-system">File System</h2>
<p>The <em>file system</em> on a modern computer can be thought of as the topmost node in a tree that represents all of the data stored on a storage device. Each hard drive, flash drive, or other storage device on a computer contains at least one <em>partition</em>, and inside of that partition is a <em>file system</em> that stores files. Of course, storage devices may contain many different partitions, each with a different file system, but that is becoming less common since storage is much cheaper than it used to be.</p>
<p>In the diagram at the top of this page, the topmost box represents the file system&rsquo;s root node.</p>
<p>On a Windows system, the root node of each file system is represented by a drive letter. Typically the main file system uses the <code>C:\</code> drive letter.</p>
<p>On OS X and Linux-based systems, the file system begins with a root node that has the path <code>/</code>. Under that root node, additional file systems can be mounted on a unique path, usually in a special directory such as <code>/mnt</code> or <code>/media</code>. We&rsquo;ll take a closer look at the Linux file system on the next page.</p>
<h2 id="directory">Directory</h2>
<p>Within a file system, data is typically separated into a hierarchical structure using <em>directories</em> or <em>folders</em>. Just like we would use folders in a file cabinet to group similar papers together, we can do the same with directories on our file systems.</p>
<p>In the diagram at the top of this page, the boxes for &ldquo;home&rdquo;, &ldquo;user2&rdquo;, and &ldquo;foo&rdquo;, among others, all represent directories that can store data within them.</p>
<p>Each directory is represented by a <em>path</em>, such as <code>C:\Users\user\Documents</code> on Windows or <code>/home/user/documents</code> on Linux.</p>
<h2 id="file">File</h2>
<p>Each individual piece of data stored on a file system is represented by a <em>file</em>. Those files can store many different types of data, from simple text and graphics to entire programs and videos.</p>
<p>As with directories, each file is also represented by a <em>path</em>, such as <code>C:\Users\user\Documents\file.txt</code> on Windows or <code>/home/user/documents/file.txt</code> on Linux.</p>
<h2 id="file-extensions">File Extensions</h2>
<p>Most file names include an optional extension at the end. The extension comes after the last period <code>.</code> character in the filename, and consists of a few characters giving information about the type of data in the file. Some common file extensions include <code>.txt</code>, <code>.docx</code>, <code>.pdf</code>, and <code>.mp3</code>.</p>
<p>Most Windows computers automatically hide these extensions from view, since Windows actually uses those extensions to determine the type of data that is stored in the file. Linux, on the other hand, uses a different system that involves looking inside the file itself, so the extension is not necessary (but helpful).</p>
<h2 id="symbolic-link">Symbolic Link</h2>
<p>Most file systems support <em>symbolic links</em> or <em>symlinks</em>, sometimes incorrectly referred to as <em>shortcuts</em>. A symbolic link allows one file path to refer to another, so they both appear to contain the same information.</p>
<p>For example, we could create a symlink at <code>/home/users/documents</code> that points to the directory <code>/data/documents</code>. So, whenever a user opens the <code>/home/users/documents</code> directory, they will actually see the files stored in <code>/data/documents</code>. Any changes made to those files will be visible to users who view the files using either path.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t deal with symlinks in this chapter, but they are something to be aware of, as we may come across them when working with file systems in practice.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we are going to learn all about how to manipulate files and directories using our programs. This is a very important part of programming, since many times we want to be able to save data for use later, or read and process existing data. If we know how to properly interface with the file system, we can do some really interesting things.</p>
<p>Before we begin, however, we need to cover some basic information about how files systems work on a modern computer. While you may be very familiar with storing and using files on your computer, many users never stop and think about what is going on behind the scenes.</p>
<p>For starters, most file systems today are structured like a tree. In Computer Science, a tree is a structure that contains nodes and branches, with the root node being shown at the top instead of the bottom. The nodes represent each directory or file, and the branches show the connections between them. Each directory can contain other directories, or files. A file would be a leaf node, since it cannot contain any other files or directories.</p>
<p>Also, we will use the term &ldquo;directory&rdquo; and &ldquo;folder&rdquo; interchangeably. They really refer to the same thing - a node in the tree that can contain child nodes, which are themselves either other directories or files.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s explore the filesystems of some common operating systems, just to get a feel for how these look in practice. On Windows, each drive or partition acts as a separate file system, so each one of those represents a root node on a tree. Inside, we see directories that contain our files. So, to find my files, we can open the <code>C:\</code> drive, followed by the <code>Users</code> folder, and finally my username.</p>
<p>One important thing to remember about Windows is that it uses a file extension to determine what the type of each file is. You may have them hidden by default, but they are easy to enable as well. You may be familiar with extensions such as PDF, DOCX, and JPG.</p>
<p>The Linux and Mac filesytems are similar. However, instead of each individual drive or partition being a separate file system, many times Linux and Mac computers use a virtual &ldquo;root&rdquo; filesystem, which each drive or partition besides the root partition contained within the root file system. Similarly, Linux includes directories and files. The major difference between Linux and Windows is how it determines the type of the file. Linux may also look at the file extension at the end of the filename, but it can also examine the contents of the file. Most major file types contain a special part at the beginning called a &ldquo;file header&rdquo; that identifies the type of the file. So, even if the file extension is missing or incorrect, many times Linux can determine the file type by examining the header.</p>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s look at the Codio filesystem. In many cases, you can find a representation of the filesystem to the left of the content. Since Codio is based on Linux, most of what we just discussed applies to Codio as well.</p>
<p>One important thing to notice is where the files in Codio are stored. Codio creates a special folder called the <code>workspace</code> folder, directly within the Codio user&rsquo;s home directory. So, the path <code>/home/codio/workspace</code> is where all of these files are located. Therefore, whenever we open a terminal, we&rsquo;ll have to be careful and make sure that we are in the correct directory before continuing. We&rsquo;ll show you how to do that in the next video.</p>
<p>Also, since Codio is based on Linux, we know that we don&rsquo;t have to worry about using the correct file extensions on our files. However, it is still a good practice to get into, as it helps us identify the types of files we are working with, and other programs besides Linux will still require those files to have the correct extensions.</p>
<p>There we go! That&rsquo;s a quick overview of file systems across a variety of systems. Next, we&rsquo;ll discuss a bit more specific information about navigating and using the Linux filesystem in Codio.</p>
