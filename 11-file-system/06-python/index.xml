      <description>Lets look at how we might take input from either a file or the keyboard. Our goal is that the program uses the first command line argument for input if it is a file. If no argument is given it should use the keyboard. If the first command line argument is not a file, or if an error occurs, the program should print &amp;ldquo;Error processing the first argument as a file&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Beyond just reading data from files, we can also create our own files and write data directly to them.
Opening a File for Writing In Python, we&amp;rsquo;ll use the .open() method we&amp;rsquo;ve been using to read from a file to also open a file for writing. So, here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what that might look like:
import sys from pathlib import Path import io class Writer: @classmethod def main(cls, args): if len(args) &amp;gt; 1: path = Path(args[1]) try: with path.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video
Video Materials
This video uses `open(str)` instead of `pathlib` Paths. Most on line sources and examples will use the older style as `pathlib` is fairly recent. The written text will use `pathlib`&#39;s approach.
Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve seen how to handle working with files in Python, let&amp;rsquo;s go through an example program to see how we can apply that knowledge to a real program.
Problem Statement Here&amp;rsquo;s a problem statement we can use:</description>

      <description>Path vs File objects In Python 2, the file system was accessed using a variety of functions built into several modules: sys, os, glob, shutil are some of the more common. The standard way to open a file was with the built-in function open(&amp;lt;str&amp;gt;).
a = open(&amp;#39;myTest.txt&amp;#39;) print (type(a)) #&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;file&amp;#39;&amp;gt; Which attempted to open the file represented by the string and returns a file-object. File-objects could be read, written to and searched.</description>

      <description>As you should recall, a Linux (Posix) path can be represented by a string, starting from the root (/).
The terminal always starts in /home/codio/workspace and we have typically worked in /home/codio/workspace/python. When in the terminal, the present working directory (pwd) is the directory &amp;ldquo;level&amp;rdquo; you are currently at.
When you invoke the Python interpreter with the command python3, Python sets the current working directory (cwd) for the program to Linux&amp;rsquo;s pwd.</description>
