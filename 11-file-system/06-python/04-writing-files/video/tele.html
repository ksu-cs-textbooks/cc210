    <meta name="description" content="YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script Let’s look at how we can write to files in Python. To do this, we simply have to open a file using the open() function just like we do to read a file. We can use a Try-Except statement with a With statement inside, which will ensure that the file is properly closed when we are done with it. Outside of that statement, we’ll add an except block for a generic exception for now, but we’ll revisit that in a bit.">

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how we can write to files in Python. To do this, we simply have to open a file using the <code>open()</code> function just like we do to read a file. We can use a Try-Except statement with a With statement inside, which will ensure that the file is properly closed when we are done with it. Outside of that statement, we&rsquo;ll add an except block for a generic exception for now, but we&rsquo;ll revisit that in a bit.</p>
<p>In this case, however, we provide a second argument to the <code>open()</code> function, &ldquo;w&rdquo;, which tells the system that we&rsquo;d like to write to that file.</p>
<p>There! That gives us the basic structure we need to write to a file. In this program, we are getting the filename from the first command-line argument, but we could easily substitute that for any string that contains a path to a file.</p>
<p>To write to the file, we can just use the <code>write()</code> method of the <code>writer</code> object. It accepts just about any writable data type, just like the <code>print()</code> function we&rsquo;ve been using to output text to the terminal.</p>
<p>However, by default, the <code>write()</code> method does not add a newline at the end of the output, so we&rsquo;ll have to manually add the newline characters to our file where we&rsquo;d like them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it! Writing to a file in Python is pretty simple. However, to make this program truly robust, there are a few exceptions we should catch and handle.</p>
<p>First, since we are reading the name of the file from the command-line arguments, we need to make sure we don&rsquo;t have an IndexError.</p>
<p>In addition, any input and output operations could cause an IOError, so we&rsquo;ll need to add another except statement for that.</p>
<p>This code gives a very simple example for writing output to a file. While it looks very complex, most of the program is simply code to handle the various exceptions that could occur when opening and writing to a file. See if you can get the example on this page to work!</p>
