    <description>Path vs File objects In Python 2, the file system was accessed using a variety of functions built into several modules: sys, os, glob, shutil are some of the more common. The standard way to open a file was with the built-in function open(&lt;str&gt;).&#xA;a = open(&#39;myTest.txt&#39;) print (type(a)) #&lt;type &#39;file&#39;&gt;Which attempted to open the file represented by the string and returns a file-object. File-objects could be read, written to and searched.</description>
