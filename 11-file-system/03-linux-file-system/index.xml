    <title>Linux File System :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/11-file-system/03-linux-file-system/</link>
    <description>The Codio programming environment uses the Linux file system to store files and directories. So, letâ€™s take a minute and discuss some features specific to the Linux file system.&#xA;Layout 1&#xA;As we discussed earlier, the Linux file system begins with a single root node which has the path /. Below that root node, there are several directories which are typically present on each Linux system. The diagram above gives information about what could be found in each of those directories.</description>
