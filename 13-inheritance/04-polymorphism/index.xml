    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/13-inheritance/04-polymorphism/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video Video Materials&#xA;Allowing a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class allows us to use those classes in very unique ways.&#xA;One way we can use those classes is through the application of polymorphism. Polymorphism can be loosely defined as “the condition of occurring in several different forms”^[https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/polymorphism], but in programming we use the term to describe the fact that an object instantiated from a class that inherits from another class can take on multiple forms, depending on how it is used.</description>
