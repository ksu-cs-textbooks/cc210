      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script Another major feature of inheritance in object-oriented programming is the ability to declare a class abstract. In essence, an abstract class cannot be instantiated, but can give the structure of attributes and methods that are inherited by child classes.
In an abstract class, at least one method should also be abstract, which means that it usually doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide any code inside of the method itself.</description>
