    <title>Shared Features in Code :: CC 210 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc210/13-inheritance/02-shared-code/</link>
    <description>Object-oriented programming allows us to represent items from the real world in our code: we use a class as a general description of each type of item, and then we can instantiate objects based on that class to represent specific items in the world.&#xA;A classic example is to consider writing a computer program to represent a school, with students and teachers represented in code as separate classes. As we can see in the diagram above, both students and teachers can have attributes and methods that help describe the information and behaviors associated with that type of item.</description>
