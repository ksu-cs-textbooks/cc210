    <description>Of course, polymorphism can make things a bit more complicated when it comes to determining exactly what type of object is stored in a variable. Thankfully, Java includes a few easy ways to determine what type of object is really stored in a variable, as well as ways that we can convert the types if needed.&#xA;Determining Data Type Letâ€™s go back to the previous example from the last page, where we had placed all of our objects in an array.</description>
